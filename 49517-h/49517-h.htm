<h2><a name="PROLOGUE" id="PROLOGUE"></a>PROLOGUE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The theatre and the circus, both sources of unlimited
amusement to the world, are also objects of the
greatest interest to all who have had even a single
peep at the stage or pressed their feet even once upon
the sawdust precincts of the tented show. The tricks
and illusions that are mystifying to nine-tenths of
those to whom they are presented rarely fail to be
productive of pleasure, and the performers, whether
before the foot-lights or within the circus ring, generally
succeed in so thoroughly winning the hearts of
the public, that, though their faces, when the paint is
off and the atmosphere of glory has departed, might
not be recognized upon the street, their names are so
fixedly identified with the pleasant moments associated
with their art, that they become household words, and
are spoken, with admiration and praise, by all classes,
from the newsboy and bootblack up through the various
strata of society even to the ruler of the nation.</p>

<p>In presenting this volume to the public the intention
has been to bring the player and the people into
closer relations, and by revealing the secrets of the
stage and sawdust arena to show that what appears at
first to be deep mystery and to many, who are bigoted
and averse to theatrical and kindred entertainments,
the blackest diabolism, is merely the result of the
simplest combinations of mechanical skill and studied
art, and is as innocent of the sinister character bestowed
upon it as are the efforts of school children at
their annual exhibitions or the exercises of a Sabbath
School class before a row of drowsy and nodding church-deacons.
Fault may be found with the private lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
of numbers of the members of the theatrical and circus
profession, but the sins and shortcomings of individuals,
can be visited upon the entire class with no
more justice than can the frailties of a few preachers
be applied generally to the pulpit, or the dishonesty
of a handful of lawyers be reflected upon all the disciples
of Blackstone in existence. Neither is it just to
class as theatres places of resort that do not deserve
the name&mdash;the "dives" and "dens" that are frequented
by disreputable men and women whose low
tastes are catered to by men and women every bit as
disreputable as their patrons. Such establishments
receive, in this volume, only the severe treatment they
fully merit.</p>

<p>In explaining the mysteries of stage representations,
and indicating the tricks of ring performances,
as well as in speaking of the private lives of performers
and giving biographies of the most noted actors and
actresses now before the public, an attempt has been
made to be perfectly accurate in every detail. The
anecdotal portion of the book has likewise received
careful attention, and indeed every feature of the
work has been given due consideration, in the hope
that in and out of the profession, <span class="smcap">Theatrical And
Circus Life</span> may meet with a favorable reception and
be regarded as worthy the subjects of which it treats.
Commending it to the kindness of all into whose
hands it falls; and assuring the inhabitants of the
mimic and real worlds, that, whatever construction
may be placed upon his sentences, naught but respect
and affection is felt for the true and good men and
women of the stage, the author parts from his volume
regretting that it is not large enough to give everybody
a place in its pages, or to say as much about each individual
as each deserves.</p>

<p>Anybody can get into the auditorium of a theatre
by paying an admission fee reaching from twenty-five
cents up to $1.50, and the sawdust precincts of the
circus may be penetrated for the modest sum of fifty
cents; but behind the curtain of the theatre and beyond
the screened door through which circus attractions enter
the exhibition arena, are sacred places, with secrets
that are so valuable to their owners that they dare not
for less than a small fortune allow the public to view
or even to understand them. A general knowledge
of the simplicity of theatrical and circus tricks&mdash;of
the delusions that make up the stock in trade of showmen
generally&mdash;would destroy their value as salable
articles, and make everybody a little Barnum or Jack
Haverly of his own, with ability to furnish himself
with amusement at home, while the former mastodonic
managers could only look on and weep at the
educational facilities with which the country was overrun,
and mourn the Shakespearian days when people
were easily pleased with the poverty-ridden stage and
bare representations that were offered them. But
there is no fear that the public will ever be instructed
up to such a high degree in regard to the inside workings
of the theatre and circus, that there will not at
all times be plenty of patrons for both these excellent
forms of entertainment. The managers take good care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
to keep their secrets to themselves, as those who go
prying around the shrines in which the theatric arcana
are held, very soon find out. At the back door of
every theatre&mdash;the entrance to the stage&mdash;is a cerberus
of the most pronounced kind, who would sooner
bite his own grandfather's ear off than allow anybody
not entitled to the privilege, to pass him; while at the
door of the circus dressing-room and all around it are
faithful sentinels who will listen to no password, and
through whose ranks it is as impossible to break as it
is for the fat boy in the side show to throw a double
somersault over seventeen horses, with an elephant as
big as Jumbo at the far end of the line. It will, however,
be the proud privilege of the readers of this book
to get as close to the secrets of the stage and sawdust
arena as one can well do without knowing absolutely all
about them, and by the time the last page is read and
the volume is ready to be closed, I think the readers
will be both delighted and astonished with the revelations
that have been made.</p>

<p>Turn the average man loose on the stage of a theatre
at night, while a play is going on, and it is a Russian
kobol against a whole San Juan mining district that he
will not know whether he has struck the seventh circle
of heaven or is in a lunatic asylum. He will meet
some very queer creatures in the scenes; he will see
many strange things; the brilliant lights around him,
the patches of color flashing into his eyes, the sea of
faces and the tangle of millinery in the auditorium, will
mystify him; the startling streaks of black upon the
faces of the men and women who jostle him as he
closely hugs the wings, their red noses and blooming
cheeks, the general tomato-can aspect of their faces,
the shaggy wigs and straggling beards that look as if
they had been torn off the back of a goat only ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
minutes before; the dismal, commonplace clothes that
shine so radiantly when seen from a chair in the parquette
or dress circle,&mdash;all these things will set his poor
brain in a whirl; and while he is looking on awe-stricken,
the scene shifters will come rushing down upon him
with a new delusion, trampling on his toes in a manner
that suggests in a most potential way his superfluity in
that particular place, and pushing him aside without the
merest apology, and perhaps with no other remark than
a fragment of fervent profanity, as if he were a wretched
street Arab in that mimic world in which the scene
shifter and the captain of the "supers" play such very
important parts. People come out of every imaginable
place all around him. There seem to be doors
everywhere,&mdash;in the walls, the floor, the ceiling, and
even in space; and as the "vasty deep" and the
rest of the surroundings give up their dwellers, the intruder
receives fresh jolts and thrusts, and possibly
additional donations of profanity. This, of course,
applies only to the male apparitions that overwhelm
the strange visitor to the new world behind the scenes.
The female portion of that illusory sphere have nothing
to say to him except with their eyes, which very
forcibly inquire the meaning of his presence there.</p>

<p>If a person would like to understand how awfully
strange and lonely it will be for the last individual left
alive upon earth, he need only pay a first visit to the
stage of a theatre where he is not acquainted with any
of the actors or actresses, and has not even the pleasure
of knowing one of the minor attaches. Any attempt to
form an acquaintance is promptly and unmistakably
repelled, and all the poor unfortunate has to do is to
move up where he is out of everybody's way, and
he can look on and wonder to his heart's content. As
he inspects his surroundings and has his attention called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
to the actions of the people whose business it is to
place the stage in shape for an act or scene of a play,
he will readily comprehend the meaning of forming a
world out of chaos. If they are getting ready the
balcony scene for "Romeo and Juliet," wing pieces are
pushed out to represent trees and the side of the house
of the Capulets&mdash;and what a house it usually is, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
for such elegant people! The front of the house is
rapidly placed in position between two wings, the balcony
is quickly nailed on, and with the aid of a rude
scaffolding behind the scene and a ladder, the fair Juliet
mounts, and, feeling her way carefully, at last steps out
upon the frail structure to tell the sweet moon her love
for Romeo. The whole thing looks ridiculous. Even the
stately daughter of the Capulets has not beauty or skill
enough to remove the absurdity from the scene which has
the appearance of being, and is in reality nothing else
than wood and canvas freely splashed with paint of
the proper colors. A painted box represents a stone;
a green carpet passes for grass; the beautiful bric-a-brac
that opens the eyes of the æsthetic people in the
audience is only brown paper hurriedly daubed by the
scene painter's apprentice; the wall of the Capulets'
garden is a very frail canvas concern, and the floral
attributes are frauds of the deepest dye from the scenic
artist's long table of colors. The whole picture is
simple, but unintelligible to the looker-on for the first
time, and as he vanishes through the door he laughs
heartily at the very thin disguise tragedy and comedy
are required to put on to delude and please the public.</p>

<p>Let him return to the theatre in the morning and
view its mysteries shorn of the dazzle and splendor
that the night brings. He will be more astonished
still. The place is usually as dark as a dungeon, there
being something peculiar in the construction of theatres
which makes them bright at night and dismal
during daylight. If a stray slant of light falls anywhere
upon the stage it will be rudely mocked by the
bits of burning candle by the aid of which the stage
carpenter is at work right in the very spot where,
twelve hours before, Romeo and Juliet lived and died
for each other in such a lamentably pathetic way that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the audience shed tears, and only gave the lachrymal
rainstorm a rest at intervals long enough to shower
the star with applause. The stage carpenter's assistant
is there too, the machinist, the scene painters, the
men who have charge of the company's baggage, the
property-man, and others. They fill the scene in a
lugubrious and wholly uninteresting way,&mdash;all are at
work, and as heedless of the attendance of strangers as
the actors and stage hands of the night before had
been. The scenes have lost their color&mdash;such as are
left, and this mimic world that had its admiring and
aspiring hundreds is as bare and desert-like as a bald
head after its owner has been using hair restoratives
for about six months. It has neither shape nor any
suggestion of its whilom beauty and attractiveness.
The green-room may be explored, and the dressing-rooms,
but they will reveal nothing; their former occupants
are probably still abed, and unless there is to
be a rehearsal they will not be seen around again until
7 o'clock at night. He must not be too searching in
his explorations or the attention of the attaches will be
attracted, and the conversation that will follow may
not be the most pleasant in the world to him. Moving
down the stairs that lead to the space under the stage,
the explorer will find it darker and more dungeon-like
still, and even if it were light nothing could be seen
but the steam boiler, for heating and power purposes,
the ventilating apparatus, the numerous trap-door
openings and the posts about them, with a few other
accessories that are hardly worth mentioning. Again
he will be forced to confess that everything is very
simple, but he cannot understand any part of it, and
again he goes away with a laugh on his lips and merriment
in his heart because the people are so easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
pleased, and theatrical managers find it so easy to
entertain them.</p>

<p>A visit to the dressing-tent of the circus will be
equally barren of appreciable results. He can see the
dazzling costumes, the shapely limbs of the females,
the gaily-caparisoned steeds, the red gold-laced coats
of the supers, and a chaotic heaping up of a number
of indescribable articles, but behind the canvas screen
that divides the tent lie secrets that he must not
attempt to penetrate, for there are the lives, the lies
and the fascinations of the performers. There, awkward
limbs receive their roundly shaping, and old age,
by a magic touch with the elixir of the "make-up"
box, puts on the masquerading bloom of youth. The
same might, to some extent, be said of the dressing-rooms
of the theatre, only the application could not
be as wide or general as in the circus profession, for
the lives these people lead soon lay waste their beauty
if they happen to be young, and crowd senility upon
them long before the usual time. Their work is always
hard, their surroundings are of the very worst kind,
they grow up in an atmosphere of fraud, and they
necessarily learn early the arts of deception whereby
their employers make fame and fortune. But I have
taken a stranger into the dressing-tent, and I must not
abuse the hospitality of the place by exposing its sins
in his presence. The stranger is introduced all around,
shakes hands with everybody, even the premiere
equestrienne, or, perhaps, the charming and daring
little lady who is twice daily shot out of a cannon, and
besides makes two headlong dives a day from the dome
of the tent into the net spread beneath. All are glad
to see him, and he is surprised to find that the two
Indians who juggle fire-brands and do other feats not
at all consistent with the traditions of the aborigines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
have not sufficient savage blood in their veins to make
respectable cigar store signs, but are base counterfeits
of the noble red man, applications of chocolate and
vermilion to their faces, and the usual accompaniment
of black hair, feathers, and deerskin clothing having
bestowed upon them all the air of the child of the
forest that they possessed. As the band sounds the
music for the riding act the equestrienne's horse
dashes tamely into the ring, and the gentlemanly
agent of the show pushes the visitor out to have him
"look at an act that beats anything of the kind in the
world."</p>

<p>As in the material or mechanical features of the
show there are mysteries of the most interesting and
instructive kind, so, too, the personal features of the
realm of entertainment&mdash;the great world of amusement&mdash;contain
much that will not only surprise, but
will tickle the unsophisticated. By lifting the veil the
least bit, the reader can have a peep at the most attractive
of the events and incidents that go to make
the romantic career of an actor or actress. There are
various little things that look simple and innocent
enough when they appear in the shape of a newspaper
paragraph that contain a world of meaning to the initiated.
There are methods of getting and keeping
players before the public of which the latter know no
more than they do of the wife of the man in the moon.
There are flagrant scandals mingling with the innocent
revels of these masquerading people, and there are,
too, some of the saintliest, sweetest, manliest and
womanliest of individuals in a profession that almost
the entire world looks upon with the wildest suspicion,
and whose bright names and fair fames can never be
tarnished by the iniquitous doings of persons lower
and less respectable in character. In all that will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
written here regarding the dark side of theatrical life,
I wish it distinctly understood that there is no desire
or intention to cast even the slightest reflection upon
the honored and respected members of a grand profession,
and wherever a seemingly sweeping and uncomplimentary
statement may be made, the reader
will be kind enough to add a saving clause in favor of
all those who do not deserve such condemnation. In
the concert saloon, the variety den, the boys' theatre,
and the numerous other dives in which vice parades
boldly and nakedly, will be found ample field for
trenchant and graphic writing. These pits of infamy
flourish everywhere, and are as freely patronized as
the charms of their female attractions are freely displayed;
the girls in short dresses, in gleaming tights,
with padded bust and cotton-rounded limbs, their seductive
wiles, their beer-thirstiness, their reckless
familiarity with male friends and strangers, alike from
the beardless boy of fourteen to the bald and withering
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roué</i>, the ample freedom with which they throw
themselves into the arms of victims and give themselves
up to the most outrageous revels; the female
minstrel gang and the break-o'-day girls, who supplement
their sins on the stage with subsequent and even
more surprising iniquity in the hop or dance that follows
the show,&mdash;all these phases of the lower strata
of theatrical life, as being more productive of interesting
secrets of a so-called stage, must be touched upon,
that the reader may be able to contrast the extremes
of the amusement world, and understand that in mimic
as well as real life, there are abject misery and squalid
sinfulness while, above all, shines the grand and stainless
character of the noble and pure-minded people
who bring genius and virtue to the profession of
which they are bright, shining ornaments.</p>

<span class="subhead">A THEATRE OF SHAKESPEARE'S DAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>If some of the old Greek dramatists could shake together
their ashes and assume life, they would open
their ancient eyes to look upon the beauty, comfort,
and charming symmetry of the first-class theatre of
the present day. The ancients were at first obliged
to put up with representations given upon rude carts;
afterwards stone theatres were constructed, with the
performers placed in a pit in the middle space, but no
such effort at decoration, or to provide for the convenience
of spectators, was to be seen as is to be found
everywhere now. The plays, too, while they may
have been delightful to our Hellenic predecessors,
would hardly draw a corporal's guard at the present
time, when spectacular melodrama is all the rage,
and the only chorus the average theatre-goer cares to
see is the aggregation of pretty girls in entrancing
tights, and with the utmost scantiness of clothes to
hide their personal charms, who sing the concerted
music in comic opera. This is the kind of chorus that
sends a thrill of ecstacy through the heart, and around
the resplendent dome of thought of the much-maligned
modern bald-head. The strophe and anti-strophe of
the ancient drama would set the nineteenth century
citizen crazy as a wild man of Borneo. The ancient
drama was gradually replaced by the ecclesiastical
drama,&mdash;the mystery or miracle play,&mdash;an example of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
which remains to us in the celebrated "Passion
Play," performed at Obarammergan at stated intervals,
and over the projected production of which, in this
country, there was so much trouble that the play was
never produced. In this style of drama, events in the
life of the Savior, or the great mysteries of the church,
were the topics dealt with by the saintly playwright,
and the actors personated characters ranging from
the Devil up through the various grades of saintliness
and angelic beatification to God Almighty himself.
The miracle play flourished during the middle ages,
and survived down almost to the Elizabethan period,
when Shakespeare appeared upon the scene; and with
his advent there came a revolution, the outgrowth of
which is the present perfect and beautiful theatre.
The change in the style of plays brought a change in
the style of places for their representations, and while
the Bard of Avon was making his reputation in
the dramatic line, the Globe and Blackfriars were
leading the way to advancement in the matter of theatrical
structures. They had performances on Sunday
in those olden times, and while good Christians
were worshipping God in their sanctuaries, the undevout
Britons of the "golden age" were worshipping
Thespis in his.</p>

<p>Let us drop back into a theatre of the Shakespearian
epoch, some Sunday afternoon when the weather is
fine, and you will not be compelled to stand bare-headed
in the pit. Let us go to the Globe. It was
situated on the Bankside. It was a wooden building,
of hexagonal shape, open to the sky, and
partly thatched. To a little tower-like projection from
the roof was fastened a staff of no inconsiderable
height, from which always fluttered the flag of England.
Windows were sparsely distributed here and
there, on each side of the building, while over the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
was displayed the figure of Hercules bearing the globe
upon his brawny shoulders. Whether the mythological
giant came with his terrestrial burden to dedicate,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in propria persona</i>, this temple to the mightiest of the
muses, or whether the whole thing was only a cunning
contrivance of some skilful artisan, embodying the
conception of a clever play writer, history does not
record.</p>

<p>Whenever a play was to be enacted, the entrance to
the Globe was always jammed with footboys, eager
for a chance to hold a gentleman's horse, or lounging
gallants, who collected to show themselves and to ogle
the ladies as they entered. It was a lively spectacle,
as stiff dames and ruffled noblemen, poor artisans and
sleek gallants, wits and critics, footmen and laborers
and ragged urchins stepped forward to pay the admittance
fee of a shilling or a sixpence, or to make a respectful
offer of their credit, which was usually most
disrespectfully condemned as unlawful tender. It was
a lively sight as gouty old gentlemen flourished huge
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">batons</i> over the scraggy heads of malicious boys who
jostled them purposely; as titled old dames in immense
flaring petticoats endeavored to smooth their
noble wrinkles, and look mincing and modest under
the impertinent gaze of the bedizened fops, and as the
fops themselves twisted and bent and bowed and
shook their powdered wigs, twirled their glove-fingers,
or turned out their toes fastidiously, at the imminent
risk of dislocating their tarsals.</p>

<p>But let us enter with the crowd and observe the internal
economy of the theatre, and the character of
the performance. Though externally hexagonal, the
building within is circular in form. There is no roof,
as before intimated, and the exhibitions occurring only
in the summer and in pleasant weather, the air is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
always serene and pure, and the audience requires no
protection from storms or wind. In the centre of the
enclosure is the pit, as in modern play-houses. Here,
"the understanding gentlemen of the ground," as
Ben Jonson has it, revelled in the delights of the
drama at sixpence a head; the bosom of the earth
their sole footstool, and the blue canopy of heaven
their only shelter. The "great unwashed did congregate"
upon this spot, sometimes in immense numbers,
to luxuriate at once in Shakespeare and tobacco; for
be it known, the ancient theatres of London were to
the working classes very much what its modern porter
and beer shops are. They were places of resort where
tradesmen and tradesmen's wives assembled to gossip
and smoke and steep.</p>

<p>Surrounding the pit upon all sides except where the
stage completed the circle, were the boxes or rooms, as
they were called. In these were assembled those who
could lay claim to rank or wealth. They were furnished
with wooden benches&mdash;a luxury of which the
pit could never boast, and which was purchased for a
shilling. It will be observed, from what has been said,
that the internal arrangements of the ancient theatres
were upon precisely the same plan as those of the
modern. The cause of this identity of structure may
be easily traced. As late as the reign of Henry VIII.,
it was customary to enact plays and pageants in the
courts of inns. These were usually quadrangular in
form, with balconies or piazzas projecting into the
court, and corresponding with the stories of the building.
The stage was erected near the entrance-gate,
and occupied one entire side of the quadrangle. The
inn-yard thus formed the pit or parquette, for the accommodation
of the "understanding gentlemen,"
while the balconies or rooms (rising above each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
in tiers varying with the number of stories) corresponded
to the boxes. It was from this crude, original
conception that the architects of Queen Elizabeth's
reign fashioned the Globe and Blackfriars, and from
thence has it come down to the present day.</p>

<p>Directly in front of the pit was the stage, protected
by a woollen curtain. Unlike modern "drops," it was
divided in the middle, and suspended by rings from
an iron rod. When the performance was about to
commence it was drawn aside&mdash;opening from the
middle; the rolling up process is an achievement of
some later mind.</p>

<p>Hark! Do you hear the gentle grating, the jingling,
the rustling of woollen? Without the slightest
premonitory symptoms there has been a rupture of
the curtain, and the mysteries it so securely hid are
most unexpectedly revealed. Seated upon wooden
stools or reclining upon the rushes with which the
stage is strewn, are a number of individuals composedly
smoking long pipes, whom the unsophisticated
might take for actors. Far from it; they are
the perpetual bane of actors&mdash;wits and gallants, who
delight in nothing so much as in exhibiting themselves
for the public to admire, or confusing the actors by
their pleasantries and disturbing the progress of the
play.</p>

<p>Protruding from the further wall of the stage is a
balcony, supported on wooden pillars, and flanked by
a pair of boxes in which those who rejoiced in being
singular or who could not afford the full price of
admission were accommodated. The balcony was
used by the actors. It served as the rostrum when a
large company was to be addressed; it was the throne
of kings and princes, the grand judgment-seat of mighty
umpires, and in cases of necessity was convenient as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
first-story window of an imaginary dwelling-house.
For this latter purpose it was particularly useful in
the garden scene between Romeo and Juliet. But
while we have been delaying in description, the rushes
upon the boards have rustled, the actors have made
their appearance, and the business of the play has
commenced.</p>

<p>For the purpose of illustrating the manner in which
performances were conducted, we select the "As You
Like It," of Shakespeare, as being most familiar to the
general reader, and also peculiarly adapted to our purpose.
Orlando and Adam make their appearance,
and a signboard nailed to one of the side entrance
communicates the altogether unsuspected fact that we
are gazing upon an orchard. We see nothing which
in any way favors the agreeable illusion: there are
the rushes, the smoking fops, the balcony and a maze
of pine boards, but nothing that looks like trees.
Still, let not these things move you to that degree
of uncharitableness or presumption that you doubt
whether there be an orchard; does not the infallible
board with its painted letters positively affirm, "This
be an orchard?" Other <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> soon enter,
and the hypothetical orchard becomes the scene of a
most animated and interesting colloquy&mdash;the assembled
company receiving no intimation that the fruit
trees are no more, until the curtain falls, or rather is
drawn, upon the first act.</p>

<p>When the woolen hangings are again separated, the
imagination is no longer painfully strained to support
the illusion of the apples, but the unerring board
directs the wandering eye to the vast forests of Arden.
Here Jaques makes his sublime forest meditations in
an area of ten feet by twelve, enclosed in rough pine
boards; his enthusiasm, considerably damped by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
provoking witticisms of critics and gallants, and his
utterances choked by the volumes of tobacco smoke
which roll in lazy, suffocating clouds toward the ceiling
from a score of pipes. The affectionate ditties of
Orlando are nailed to visionary trees, and he makes
passionate love to the fair Rosalind amid fumes which
strangle tender phrases, and convert sighings into pulmonary
symptoms of a different character.</p>

<p>It should here be observed by way of explanation,
that Rosalind, when personated in Elizabeth's time,
was fair only by courtesy; for female parts were enacted
during her reign, and indeed, during many subsequent
reigns, by boys or young men. There is an
anecdote related of Charles II., which is a matter of
history, and illustrates this point very well. It is
said that on one occasion, visiting the theatre at the
bringing out of a new play, by some great author,
he became impatient at the unusual delay in drawing
asunder the curtain. The royal wrath soon became
extreme, and it was essential to the prospects of the
"management" that it should be appeased. Accordingly,
when the vials of imperial indignation were
about to be emptied promiscuously upon the assembly,
when the storm was just about to burst, a messenger
from the green-room informed his majesty that the
fair heroine had not finished shaving,&mdash;and the tempest
immediately subsided. At each successive act
new boards with fresh inscriptions inform us of the
situation of the performers. The saloons of the duke's
palace and the cottage of the peasant&mdash;scenes in
doors and scenes out of doors&mdash;are precisely the
same, with the exception of the invariable and ever-changing
signboard.</p>

<p>But there is one novelty, one new feature in the
representation as the play progresses. It will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
recollected that the balcony was mentioned as furnishing
a throne for princes, and a judgment-seat for dispensers
of justice. During the wrestling contest
between Charles and Orlando, this most serviceable
commodity comes into requisition. Here sits the
"duke" as umpire of the combat and general of the
troops and retainers who stand on guard below. It
is quite refreshing to hear his stentorian voice issuing
from so unusual a quarter&mdash;it furnishes quite an
agreeable relief to the tedious monotony of insipid
dialogue going on among the rushes below.</p>

<p>The play, however, proceeds rather sluggishly from
the utter meagreness and insufficiency of the "scenery,
machinery and decorations," so indispensable to the
attractiveness of theatrical exhibitions. The tradesmen
in the pit turn their backs to the stage and their
eyes to the skies, as they clasp affectionately the
almost exhausted flagon, and pour into their thirsty
throats the residue of half a dozen potations. The
crimpled dames in the boxes relax their majestic
stiffness, and relapse somnolent into the arms of the
gouty old gentlemen, their husbands. The wits and
"clever" men upon the stage grow more boisterous
in their pleasantries, and fumigate more zealously as
they pelt the unfortunate actors with rushes, or trip
them as they "exeunt." To the vulgar crowd the
only attractions which the performance offers, are the
brilliant dresses of the actors and the vestige of a plot
which the personation enables them to glean. As a
general thing, however, the stage now receives hardly
any attention. Pipes, tankards, and gossip are the
order of the day, and everybody is glad when Orlando
succeeds in obtaining his hereditary rights, wins the
hand of the beautiful Rosalind, is dismissed in happiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
and the woolen screen slips along its iron rod
for the last time.</p>

<p>Such was the style of dramatic exhibitions in the
Elizabethan era. The stage was totally devoid of all
scenic appendages calculated to produce the illusion
necessary to add interest and intelligence to the plot.
Rocks and trees, palaces and hamlets, places of festivity
and scenes of shipwreck, all existed merely in
the imagination, with neither properties nor scenery
to aid in the deception.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE AMERICAN THEATRE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Good-natured, rosy-cheeked, cheerful little Davy
Garrick, as Dr. Johnson called the tragedian, was in
the zenith of his glory at the Drury Lane, London,
about the middle of the last century, and Goodman's
Fields, which had cradled the wonderful actor, was in
its decline. It declined so rapidly after Garrick
deserted it that its manager, Wm. Hallam, failed in
1750, and the theatre was closed. Hallam at once
turned his thoughts toward America as a field in which
his fortune might be replenished,&mdash;English actors and
managers still look upon this country as an El
Dorado,&mdash;and so he consulted with his brother Lewis
Hallam, a comedian, and the two came to the conclusion
to organize a company and run the risk of being
scalped by what they considered the liberal but bloodthirsty
tomahawk-wielding citizens of the New World.
They got a company together, twenty-four stock plays,
many of them Shakespearian, were selected, with
eight farces and a single pantomime, "The Harlequin
Collector, or The Miller Deceived." Wm. Hallam
and his brother were to share the profits of the venture,
and the former was to remain at home while the
latter managed the company and threw in his services
as first low comedian, his wife and children also taking
parts in the performances.</p>

<p>Under the direction of Lewis the company, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
some scenery, costumes, and all the usual stage accessories,
set sail on board the Charming Sally in 1752.
During the voyage when the weather permitted, the
company rehearsed their plays on the quarter-deck
of the vessel, having the crew and officers for their
audience, and receiving from them many manifestations
of the delight which their histrionic efforts
brought to the Jack Tars' hearts. They landed at Williamsburg,
then the capital of Virginia, and the manager
after a diligent search found a store-house on
the outskirts of the town, which he thought would
suit his purpose. This he leased and metamorphosed
into a theatre with pit, gallery, and boxes, and having
the establishment ready on September 5, 1752, on that
day the first performance ever given in America by
a regular company of comedians, was given to a presumably
large and delighted audience. As was the
custom in those days, the bill was a double one, consisting
of "The Merchant of Venice" and the farce
"Lethe." The cast for "The Merchant of Venice"
was as follows: <i>Bassanio</i>, Mr. Rigby; <i>Antonio</i>, Mr.
Clarkson; <i>Gratiano</i>, Mr. Singleton; <i>Salanio</i> and
<i>Duke</i>, Mr. Herbert; <i>Salarino</i> and <i>Gobbs</i>, Mr. Wignel;
<i>Launcelot</i> and <i>Tubal</i>, Mr. Hallam; <i>Shylock</i>, Mr.
Malone; <i>Servant to Portia</i>, Master Lewis Hallam (being
his first appearance on any stage); <i>Nerissa</i>, Miss
Palmer; <i>Jesica</i> (her first appearance on any stage),
Miss Hallam; <i>Portia</i>, Mrs. Hallam. The cast for
"Lethe" was as follows (the <i>Tailor</i> having been cut
out, and the part of <i>Lord Chalkston</i> not having been
written into the farce at the time the Hallam company
left England): <i>Esop</i>, Mr. Clarkson; <i>Old Man</i>, Mr.
Malone; <i>Fine Gentleman</i>, Mr. Singleton; <i>Frenchman</i>,
Mr. Rigby; <i>Charon</i>, Mr. Herbert; <i>Mercury</i>,
Mr. Adcock; <i>Drunken Man</i> and <i>Tattoo</i>, Mr. Hallam;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
<i>John</i>, Mr. Wignel; <i>Mrs. Tattoo</i>, Miss Palmer; <i>Fine
Lady</i>, Mrs. Hallam.</p>

<p>The Williamsburg theatre was a very rude structure,
and so near the woods that the manager could, as he
often did, stand in the back door of the building and
shoot pigeons for his dinner. Still the company remained
here for a long time and met with much success.
The house was finally destroyed by fire and the company
removed to Annapolis, where a substantial building
was converted to their use and where they remained
with fortune favoring them until they got ready to go
to New York. This they did in 1753, opening a
theatre in the metropolis on September 17th, that on
Nassau Street, in a building afterwards occupied by
the old Dutch Church. The bill for the first night was
"The Conscious Lovers" and the ballad-farce "Damon
and Phillida." But three performances were given each
week&mdash;on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays&mdash;and
this continued to be the rule up to the beginning of
the present century. The price of admission was
eight shillings to the boxes, six shillings to the pit and
three shillings to the gallery. This was on the first
night, but the second night the prices were lowered to
six shillings, five shillings, and three shillings for boxes,
pit, and gallery respectively, and by the middle of October
a fourth reduction was made, so that admission to
the pit could be had for four shillings and to the gallery
for two shillings. The performance began at six o'clock,
and on the bill for the opening night appears
a request that ladies and gentlemen will come
to the theatre in time, and a statement that nothing
under the full price will be taken during the entire
performance. This seems to be a departure from
the custom of the mother country, where half price
was received for admission after the third act. The
Nassau Street theatre was closed on the evening of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
March 18, 1754, with "The Beggars' Opera" and
"The Devil to Pay."</p>

<p>While the company was still in New York, Manager
Hallam was endeavoring to come to terms with the
Quakers of Philadelphia, who strenuously objected to
having players in their midst, or to allowing stage representations
in their city. Mr. Malone, a member of the
company, was at length sent on to the Quaker City, as
Hallam's ambassador, and after considerable trouble
succeeded in obtaining Gov. Hamilton's permission to
present twenty-four plays and their attendant farces
provided there was nothing indecent or immoral in
them. In April, 1754 the company gave its first performance
in Philadelphia, playing the tragedy of "The
Fair Penitent," and the farce, "Miss in Her Teens."
The building occupied by the actors is designated by
William Dunlap, the historian of the early American
theatre, as "the store-house of a Mr. Plumstead," and
was situated "on the corner of the first alley above Pine
Street." After the twenty-four performances had
been given by "authority of his excellency," Gov.
Hamilton, the players were allowed to add six more
nights, after which they returned to New York. Here
they erected a theatre on Cruger's wharf, between
Old Slip and Coffee House Slip, and prospered.</p>

<p>Boston did not have a theatre until 1792, and then
got its first place of amusement only because Wignell
and three other members of Hallam's company, for
some reason or other, seceded from it. The seceders
brought to their standard some money men of the Hub,
a building was erected, and on August 10, 1792, the
first show was given; feats on the tight rope and acrobatic
and other artists contributing to the entertainment.
Five years later New York had two theatres, one on
the Johns, and the other on Greenwich Street, and when
the nineteenth century began, amusements were in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
flourishing condition in all the large cities of the country,
and the theatre had taken firm root and gave full
promise of its present prosperity in the New World.</p>

<p>They were a queer band, these early strollers on
American soil. It reads like a romance to follow them
through the history of their early struggles, and to
scrutinize the personal peculiarities of the individuals
who composed the company. One of them&mdash;I forget
which at the present moment&mdash;was an imaginative
fellow given up to all sorts of schemes and inventions,
and published far and wide the announcement that he
had discovered a process of manufacturing salt from
sea water. A member of one of the earliest orchestras&mdash;a
short time after Hallam had ceased furnishing
music to his audience with "one Mr. Pelham and his
harpsichord" or the single fiddle of a Mr. Hewlett&mdash;had
been a Catholic priest in Switzerland, and had
suffered the tortures of the Inquisition. He told his
story to his manager one day and it was really touching.
His mother, he said, had dedicated him in his
infancy to the priesthood. When he became old
enough he was placed in a theological seminary,
instructed and duly ordained. He was a priest when
Spain went to war against France. His canton raised
a regiment, and the priest being made its chaplain accompanied
it to Madrid. In Madrid he for the first
time learned to love. He met in the street a handsome
Spanish lady who won his heart and lit the fire
of passion in his frame. He became acquainted with
her, and ascertained that the lady reciprocated his affection.
There were many moments of stolen pleasure,
many sighs and vows, until they finally agreed to flee
together to America. The day and hour were
agreed upon, and the lovers were in readiness, when a
strong hand was laid upon the recreant priest's shoulder
and he was thrown into prison. He realized his awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
position at once, knowing that he was in the power of
that monster, the Inquisition. For weeks he remained
chained to the floor of his cell. Once he was led out to
execution, but by some miracle or accident, was saved.
At last, having suffered severely, he was put to the torture,
and weak, dying, and distracted was led to the
gate of his prison, thrust out into the street, and
warned as he valued his life to leave Madrid within ten
days. It is needless to say he did so, and never learned
or saw anything more of his Spanish sweetheart.</p>

<p>From the rude and uncomfortable theatre of a century
ago, with dressing-rooms under the stage, and but a
single fiddle or harpsichord player for the orchestra,
with poorly lighted and illy ventilated auditoriums,
with meagre scenery and ragged wardrobes&mdash;from the
primitive theatre of the New World has grown the magnificent,
symmetrical, and elegantly appointed houses
of amusement of the present day&mdash;structures beautifully
and chastely ornamented in their exteriors, while
their interiors have received the most delicate touches
of the artist's brush and the most careful attention
from the upholsterer&mdash;beautiful in color and drapery,
rich in furniture, and the very perfection of architectural
design. Our stages are revelations of dramatic
completeness, sometimes presenting scenic pictures
that challenge nature itself in their attractiveness, and
at all times surrounding the actors of a play with accessories
gorgeous and extensive enough to mystify as
well as delight nine out of every ten patrons of the
theatre. The manner in which these extraordinary
and pleasing illusions are produced is one of the great
secrets of the stage, and when the mechanism employed
is explained the reader will be surprised to learn
how simple and almost undisguised are the methods
whereby the people behind the scenes work and multiply
wonders.</p>

<span class="subhead">AT THE STAGE-DOOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The patrons of the theatre must all find their way
into the house through the front doors; only the privileged
few are allowed access to the mysteries and
wonders of the stage through the back door. Here
stands a gentleman, generally of repulsive mien and
unattractive manners, whose special business it is to
see that nobody, not entitled to do so, penetrates the
sacred precincts, and who learns at once to distinguish
between the people who come prying around his bailiwick
merely for curiosity, and those who are there to
"mash" a susceptible ballet girl or perhaps an indiscreet
member of the company. Those who are led to the
stage-door by curiosity are numerous and they are all
promptly repulsed; and the "mashers" who stand at
the stage-door after the performance is over, must get
into the good graces of the door-keeper, and retain his
friendship if they desire the course of true love to run
smoother than the old adage says it runs.</p>

<p>In the large theatres of Eastern cities the cerberus
who guards the stage entrance generally has a little
sentry box just inside the door, with a window cut in
it, a stove placed inside in cold weather, a number of
pigeon-holes for letters, and indeed all modern conveniences,
as the saying goes. Here he sits and
smokes, hailing everybody who passes in and saying a
kind or snarling word to all who pass out. If the mail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
has brought a letter for any member of the company,
or a "masher" has sent one of the girls a dainty little
note expressive of the sentiment that is swelling in
his twenty-six-inch bosom, the cerberus will have it,
and will hand it out to the person for whom it is
intended with an appropriate and not always complimentary
remark about it. Sometimes this guardian
of the theatric arcana will take advantage of his position
to tyrranize over the ballet girls and other subordinates
of a company, and will rule in his autocratic
way to his own pecuniary and other profit. In the
East he is made a kind of time-keeper, notes when
the performers appear for duty and when they are
absent, besides otherwise making himself serviceable
to the management and careful of the interests of his
house.</p>

<p>A story is told about one of them&mdash;I think his
name was Bulkhead&mdash;who was employed at a theatre
where the ballet was large, and the girls paid very
liberal tribute to him. They gave him silk handkerchiefs
of the prettiest and most expensive kind to wipe
his fantastic mug on; they paid for innumerable hot
drinks with which he rounded out the waist of his
pantaloons; they dropped cigars into his always outstretched
paw, and otherwise drained their own
resources to make Mr. Bulkhead as happy and comfortable
as possible. He, at first, took whatever was
offered, but soon grew bold, and demanded fifty cents
each of their little five dollars a week, every salary
day. The girls made up their minds not to accede to
this demand, which they deemed unjust and exorbitant;
they not only positively refused to give Bulkhead any
money, but would give him nothing else, not even a
two-cent cigar. As a result, about one-half of the girls
forfeited a portion of their salaries next pay-day. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
aroused all the fury there was in the entire ballet, and
when they found out, too, that Bulkhead had driven
away their male admirers they were as wild as so many
hyenas. It did not take long for them to hit upon a
means of wreaking vengeance upon the heartless and
unscrupulous door-keeper. They clubbed together
what change they had and got Bulkhead boiling
drunk; by the time the show was over on that (to him)
memorable night he did not know which way to look for
Sunday. After the final curtain had fallen and the
lights were dimmed, Bulkhead sat at the door on his stool
swaying like an unsteady church-steeple and snoring
like an engine when its boiler is nearly empty. The
girls picked him up and carried him into a remote
corner of the stage, where they piled a lot of old
scenery around him after tying his hands and feet
securely. Then they got red and blue fire ready, almost
under his cherry red and panting nose; one of
the girls took her position at the thunder drum; another
had hold of the rain wheel; another was at the
wind machine; a fourth got a big brass horn out of the
music room and a fifth got the bass drum; the remainder
stood ready to lend assistance with their hands and
throats. At a given signal the thunder rolled loudly,
the wind whistled vigorously, the rain came down in torrents,
the brass horn moaned piteously, the bass drum
was beaten unmercifully, and pans of burning blue
and red fire were poked through crevices in the piled-up
machinery right under the drunken door-keeper's
nostrils, while all the girls shouted at the tops of their
voices and clapped as enthusiastically as if they were
applauding a favorite. Bulkhead after opening his eyes
and having his ears assailed by the din, shouted wildly
for assistance and mercy and all kinds of things; but
he got neither assistance nor mercy. The racket continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
for nearly ten minutes when quiet and darkness
were restored, and the girls quietly stole away leaving
Bulkhead alone in his agony under the pile of scenery,
where he was found by the stage carpenter next morning,
a first-class, double-barrelled case of jim-jams. He
is now in an insane asylum, and employs most of his
time telling people that notwithstanding all Bob Ingersoll's
buncombe and blarney there must be a hereafter,
for he has himself been through the sunstroke section
of it.</p>

  <div class="caption">DECORATING A SCENE PAINTER.</div></div>

<p>The ballet girls of another theatre played an equally
effective and amusing trick upon an obnoxious scene
painter. The artist had been in the habit of painting
posts, doorsteps, etc., in the neighborhood of the
stage-door in colors that were not readily perceptible,
and when the young ladies' "mashes" came around
after the performance to wait for them to dress, they
innocently sat down upon or leaned against the fresh
paint and ruined their clothes. The scene painter and
his friend were always in the neighborhood to raise a
laugh when the disaster was made known, and the result
was that the gay young men would come
near the stage-door no more, and that the sweetly
susceptible creature known as the ballet girl was
obliged to go home alone, supperless. Well, one day
the girls found the artist asleep against his paint-table
with a half emptied pitcher of beer by his side. This
was their opportunity. One of the girls who was of a
decorative Oscar-Wilde-like turn of mind got a small
brush while another held the colors, and in ten minutes
they had that man's face painted so that he would pass
for a whole stock of scenery; the tattooed Greek was
a mere five-cent chromo alongside of him, and a Sioux
Indian with forty pounds of war-paint on would be a
ten-cent side-show beside a twelve-monster-shows-in-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>one-under-a-single-canvas
exhibition. In this elaborate
but undecorative condition the scene painter wandered
off to a neighboring saloon, the wonder and merriment
of all who saw him. He did not understand the cause
of the general stare and unusual laugh at him, until a
too sensitive friend took him to a mirror and showed
him his frescoed features. Profanity and gnashing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
teeth followed, and the artist was prevented from going
back to the theatre to murder ten or twelve people
only by a thoughtful policeman who picked him up as
he flew out through the door of the saloon, and carried
him off to the calaboose. He was sorry when he got
sober, and from that day to this has not attempted to
paint the coat-tails of the ballet girls' lovers.</p>

<p>A great many of these lovers, as they are designated,
are bold and heartless wretches, who have in some
way or other obtained an introduction to or scraped
acquaintance with the sometimes fair young creatures
who fill in the crevices and chinks of a play, or air
their limbs in the labyrinths of a march, or shake them
in some strange and fascinating dance. They look upon
the ballet girl, whether she be a dancer or merely below
the line of utility, as legitimate prey, and without
the slightest scruple will waylay or spread a net to
catch her in some quiet but successful manner. They
forget that many girls enter the theatre with the intention
of making honorable and honest livings; that
they prize their virtue as highly as the most respected
young lady who moves in the topmost circles of the
best society, and that the theatrical profession is only
misrepresented by the men and women who give
themselves up to debauchery, and allow their passions
to run riot to such an extent that they win notoriety
of the most unsavory and unenviable kind. It is only
because the stage is besieged by so many scoundrels
and villains who have either bought or begged the
privileges of the back door that the profession is dangerous
to young and innocent girlhood. The stage
itself is pure, and could be kept so, if these hangers-on
were only done away with and the youthful student
and aspirant for histrionic honors were allowed to pursue
her vocation unassailed by the handsome tempters
who begin by flattery and after an usually easy conquest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
end the dream of love by rudely casting the
fallen girl aside to make room for another victim.</p>

<p>Stand here in the shadow awhile. The performance
is at an end, and the gentlemen who haunt the stage-door
are beginning to assemble. There are probably
a half dozen of them. They stand around sucking the
heads of their canes and anxiously awaiting the appearance
of their inamoratas. A burlesque company
has the theatre this week, and there are probably
eighteen or twenty handsome young ladies in the combination.
Nearly every one of them is a "masher,"
and can be depended upon to hit the centre of a weak
male heart, with an arrow from her beaming eye, at
one hundred yards. Some of them have received
tender notes from the front of the house during the
night, making appointments for a private supper at one
of the free and easy restaurants; others have met
their gentlemen friends before and can depend upon
them to wait at the stage-door every night. Those
who send the notes during the performance are of what
is classed as the ultra-cheeky kind. A man of this
class will do anything to make the acquaintance of a
ballet or chorus girl. I knew one, one night, to push
a dozen different notes under the door of Eme Rousseau's
dressing-room, which opened into the parquette,
and he would not desist until Samuel Colville, the
manager, caused him to be dragged out of the theatre
and given over to the police. Another gentleman of
the same proclivities having failed to gain Alice Oates's
attention when she was in Chicago, followed her to St.
Louis, Cincinnati, and Louisville, and still being unable
to effect a proper "mash," endeavored to introduce
himself successfully and gain her favor forever by
making her a present of a pair of fast horses. Alice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
very sensibly refused to accept the gift, and told the
fond and foolish young man to go home to his mother.</p>

<p>Many cases of this kind might be cited to show how
easily the women who enter the profession, partly for
the purpose of prostituting their art, find easy conquest
among the hair-brained fellows who are only too willing
to be captives and rarely try to break the fetters
of roses with which they find themselves bound. But
keep here in the shadow a while and watch the manœuvres
of the "mashers." The stage-door opens and
out comes a very modest little girl. She does not belong
to the combination playing at the house this week,
but is a member of the regular ballet of the theatre,&mdash;one
of the few poor creatures who are obliged to
get into ridiculous costumes of enormous dresses or
unpadded tights, to increase the throng of court-ladies,
the number of pages, or add to the proportions of a
crowd. She does not dress any better than a girl who
finds employment in a factory. She is young, however,
and stage-struck. She has gone into the profession,
braving all its dangers and with a firm resolution to go
unscathed through it, carrying with her a sincere love
for art and a burning desire to attain eminence.
But alas! she has little talent, and absolutely no genius.
This can be seen and appreciated already,
although she has not had two lines to speak since entering
the theatre. She has been in the employ of the
house only since the beginning of the season. The
"mashers" part to make room for her as with eyes
cast down she trips along the street. Some of them
say smart and pretty things, and some have the impudence
to raise their hats and bid her good-evening.
She pays no attention to them, however, and it is
probably fortunate that the tall muscular gentleman in
work-day clothes who has had a pass to the gallery or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
may not have been in the theatre at all, and who is
waiting a block below to escort her home, does not
know the petty insults that are put upon her or the
snares that beset her path. Every night the big burly
fellow waits for the modest little ballet girl to see her
home in safety. The girl does not tell them at home
to what dangers she is exposed, and they never learn
until sometime the fall comes, when a troupe of negro
minstrels or a large comic opera chorus invade the
house and lay siege to the hearts of all the females
they find behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Here come two laughing blondes through the stage
door. The light falling upon their faces shows that
although they try to appear light and cheery, there is
weariness in their limbs and perhaps distress in their
hearts. They select their male friends at once; indeed,
the latter have been waiting for the gay burlesquers.</p>

<p>"Charley dear, I didn't see you in front to-night,"
says one.</p>

<p>"Neither did I," says the other; "but George was
there. I could tell him by his red eyes and cherry
nose."</p>

<p>"Yes," responds Charley, "there was too much
champagne in that last bottle, and I didn't care about
getting out of bed until half an hour ago."</p>

<p>"You had considerable of the juicy under your
vest, last night," the first girl remarks; and then there
is a laugh, and Charley says he feels in a good humor
for tackling more wine at that particular moment, and
the quartette move off to a hack-stand, jump into an
open carriage and with lots of laughter the party are
driven away to some suburban garden with wine-room
attachment, or to some urban restaurant where wine
may flow as freely as morality may fade away with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
speeding hours, and the pleasure may last just as
long as the restauranteur thinks he is being well paid
for the privileges of his establishment.</p>

<p>Another girl comes through the stage-door. She is
probably twenty-four years of age, is tall, handsome,
and most attractive in her manners. There is the
least suspicion of the matron in her appearance, that
dignity of carriage that characterizes women after
marriage being clearly defined in her motions. She
knows somebody has been waiting for her,&mdash;a young
fellow as tall, handsome, and attractive as herself. He
sees her at once as she comes out, and goes to meet
her. Her footsteps are bent in his direction also. As
they come together she lays her hand upon his extended
arm, and <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"No, Fred, I cannot go to-night. Sister is sick at
the hotel, and the baby has no one to take care of her.
I must go home to my child."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" says Fred, "I had everything arranged
for an elegant drive and a rattling supper."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, Fred;" the woman pleads, "but I
can't go to-night. You will have to excuse me this
once. You know it was daylight when we parted this
morning."</p>

<p>"I know," her friend insisted; "but what's the use
in worrying about the baby. She's probably asleep
now and won't need your care. Come, go along."</p>

<p>"No, I cannot. I will not to-night." But Fred
continues to plead, asking the pleasure of her presence
at a supper, just for a half hour and no more. Unable
to resist the warmth of his appeals, she at last
consents, and it is safe to say, that once the evening's
entertainment begins, morning breaks upon the sleepy
babe and sick sister at the hotel before Fred and his
companion are ready to part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
I knew a friend&mdash;a dramatic writer&mdash;who stood at
the back door one night and waited for a pair of pretty
chorus singers. My friend had another friend with
him&mdash;a prominent merchant. The two gay and giddy
young girls, who were only foolish flirts, did not know
that the gentlemen who had invited them to a midnight
ride and a late supper were married. Indeed, they
may not have cared. So when the opera of "Olivette"
was over and the pair of chorus singers
emerged at the back door of the stage and found the
two gentlemen waiting patiently for them, the girls
each gave over a bundle to her particular friend to
have him carry in his pocket until such time as the
quartette got ready to separate. The bundles each
contained a pair of pink "symmetricals"&mdash;padded
tights. The young ladies informed their friends of
this fact, and cautioned them to be sure to return the
bundles before leaving. Well, the night wore on joyously
with wine and singing and the usual pleasures of
a late drive. At last, at 3 <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, the girls got ready
to return to their hotel. They were driven thither,
and the entire party having imbibed more wine than
was necessary, soft and sweet adieus were so tenderly
spoken that nobody thought about the two pairs of
pink symmetricals. The gentlemen ordered the carriage
driver to speed homeward with them, and he did
so. First the dramatic writer disembarked at the door
of his residence, ran up stairs, pulled off his clothes,
and was soon sound asleep. The merchant was soon
at his own door, had settled with the driver and the carriage
had just rolled away when, as he was fumbling
at the latch-key he thought of the pair of tights.
With one bound he cleared the steps, and running
into the street, shouted after the carriage. The driver
heard him, stopped, and was given the pair of tights to
take around to the chorus girl's hotel that day and a $5<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
bill to pocket for the services. It was a narrow escape
for the merchant. For the dramatic writer it was no
escape at all. He was rudely awakened at ten o'clock
in the morning, and the first sight that met his eyes
was his infuriated wife holding the pair of pink tights
by the toes and stretching them out so that the sin of
the husband stood revealed to him in all its fulness.</p>

<p>"Where did these come from?" the exasperated
wife shrieked, flaunting them before the husband's
eyes.</p>

<p>"Where did you get them?" He asked, trembling,
and unable to think of any good excuse to make.</p>

<p>"I got them in your coat pocket," his spouse
shouted, piling up the evidence and agony in a way
that was excruciating.</p>

<p>"By jingo! is that so?" exclaimed the husband,
coming suddenly to a sitting posture in bed, and bringing
his hands together vehemently. "Now, I'll bet
$4 Charley &mdash;&mdash;," giving the name of his merchant
friend, "put them there. He told me he had a pair that
he was going to make a present of to one of the "Olivette"
girls at the &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>Brilliant as this thought was, it did not satisfy the
little lady. She kept up the argument all day, and
that night paid a visit to the merchant's wife, where
the affair got into such a tangle that the two husbands
brought in a bachelor friend to shoulder the blame,
and who made the excuse that the whole thing was a
trick put up by a few gentlemen (among them the
bachelor was not) on the dramatic man and merchant
to get them into domestic trouble, as they had succeeded
in doing, beyond their most sanguine desires.</p>

<p>And now that we have been long enough at the back
door of the theatre, let us go home and come around
to-morrow night to have a view of the plagues and annoyances
to be found before the foot-lights.</p>

<span class="subhead">BEFORE THE FOOT-LIGHTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There are people who patronize the theatre who do
not go there simply to see the play or to be pleased by
the players, and whose interest in the stage is more
than double discounted by the interest they manifest in
and towards the audience. The "masher" makes it
a market in which to display his fascinations and call
upon the susceptible fraction of femininity to inspect
and avail themselves of his heart-breaking and soul-wasting
wares. Whether he modestly takes his stand
in the rear of the auditorium, overcoat on arm and
stove-pipe hat gracefully poised upon the thumb of his
left hand, while, with polished opera-glass, he sweeps
the sea of variegated millinery and obtrusive-hued cosmetics,
or bravely hangs up his charms to view on the
front row of the dress circle, or prominently displays
them in a proscenium box, he is ever the same offensive
and shameless barber-and-tailor-shop decoration,
moved by a wild ambition to attract and hold feminine
attention, and always attaining to a degree of notoriety
among the masculine theatre-goers that keeps him
overwhelmed with contempt, and causes him to be as
readily recognized as if he had a tag tied to his back or
spread across his vest front, declaring him to be a
fisher after femininity. When the "masher" takes
the shape of the young blood, whose short and tightly-fighting
coat is matched by the shallowness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
crown of his straight-brimmed hat, and whose eye-glasses
straddle his nose as gracefully as his twenty-five-cent
cane is carried
in his hand, and this irresistible
combination of
attractions is thrust upon
the audience from a box
opening, the acme of the
lady-killing art is reached
and if all the world does
not admire the effective
tableau it must be because
all the world is
unappreciative and the
"masher" stands on an
æsthetic plane to which
the rest of mankind cannot hope to aspire.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE "MASHER."</div></div>

<p>But the "masher" is only a fraction of the class of
amusement patrons to which attention has been called
in the opening sentence of this chapter. Apart from
the people who deem it their duty to come tramping
into the theatre while the performance is going on,
and whose coming is followed by a triumphal flourish
of banging seats, and the heaving footbeats of hurrying
ushers, to the intense disgust of all who care to
hear the first act of the play, there are others who
have a hundred ways of annoying an audience, and
who make a very effectual use of their gifts in this
direction. There is the member of the "profesh,"&mdash;the
gaseous advance agent, or the bloviate business
manager, the actor "up a stump," or the "super"
who has played the part of a silent but spectacular
lictor with John McCullough or Tom Keene, and who
sits in the rear of the house, but sufficiently forward
to be distinctly heard by people in the dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
circle, criticising the mannerisms of the ladies or
gentlemen on the stage and "guying" everybody
in the cast from the star down to the frightened and
stiff-kneed little ballet girl whom an inscrutable Providence
has allowed to wander in upon the scene occasionally,
to say, "Yes, mum," or "No, mum." The
leisurely but loud professional who thus disports himself
must necessarily enjoy a large share of the
audience's attention, and the more of this he attracts
the more he is encouraged to be extravagant in his
criticisms and unreserved in his elocution. He sometimes
must dispute the title to obstreperous obtrusiveness
with some liquor-laden auditor who has succeeded
in passing the door-keeper only to find that the heat
of the house has accelerated his inebriation and given
freedom and license to his tongue until the "bouncer"
lifts him out of his seat by the collar and deposits him in
a reflective and emetic mood on the curbstone in front
of the theatre. Then, too, a crowd of friends sometimes
get together in the parquette, who begin a conversation
before the first curtain rises and keep it going on in
careless and annoying tones until the final flourish of
the orchestra arrives with the dimming of the lights
as the audience files out. But if the loud members of
the "profesh," the interjective inebriate, and the crowd
of communicative friends are not on hand to furnish diversion
for the folks who are trying to follow what is
going forward on the stage, there is one other never-failing
source of distraction and annoyance&mdash;the giddy
and gushing usher. It is safe to bet that just when the
most pathetic passage of a play is reached, or the
tragedian is singing smallest, a few ushers will throw
themselves hastily together in the lobby and hold a
mass meeting long and loud enough to be taken for a
November night political meeting, if there were only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
a stake wagon and a few Chinese lanterns strewn
around. Indeed, the usher seems to assume that he
is a sort of safety-valve through which a disturbance
must break out now and then to offset the quiet of the
audience. If the usher isn't plying his fiendish proclivity,
some bald-headed man in the parquette is sure
to throw his skating rink over the back of the seat, and,
with shining brow turned up towards the sun-burner in
the dome, mouth rounded out like the base of a cupola
and nostrils working like a suction pump, his beautiful
snore will rise above the wildest roar of the orchestra
and drown the mellifluous racket of the big bass
drum, until some friendly hand disturbs the dreamer,
and the "or-g-g-g-g-g-g-g!" that rushes up his nostrils,
down his throat and out through his ears, is thus
gently and perhaps only temporarily interrupted. The
enthusiast&mdash;the man who is carried away by the spirit
of the scene&mdash;is also a source of annoyance, and
when he signifies from the balcony his willingness to
take a hand in what is being enacted on the stage,
damning the villain heartily, and, like the sailor of
old, openly sympathizing with femininity in distress,
he first becomes a target for the gallery boys' gutter-wit
and finally a prey to the inexorable "bouncer,"
who roams around the upper tiers of every theatre and
unceremoniously dumps disturbers down stairs. Last,
but by no means least, in the distracting and disturbing
features at theatrical performances is the peanut
cruncher. He is the most cold-blooded and least
excusable of all the annoyances with which amusement
patrons are afflicted. He wraps his teeth around the
roasted goober, utterly reckless of the distress he is
stirring up in the bosoms of those around him, and he
grinds and smacks and continues to crunch, stopping
occasionally to charge his dental quartz-crusher anew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
and always beginning on the latest goober with the
greatest ferocity, while he seems to make it go ten
times further, as far as time and agony are concerned,
than any of its predecessors. All the other disturbance
consequent upon attending a play are petty,
compared with peanut-crunching, and it is the opinion
of the writer that a law should be passed at once,
making it a felony for any banana-stand or hand-cart
man to sell peanuts to citizens who are on their way
to the theatre. If such a law were passed, and if it
were not a dead letter, the people whose backbones
feel as if they were being fondled by a circular saw
every time they hear the rustling of a goober-shell,
would flop right down on their knees and renew their
confidence in the wisdom of Providence.</p>

<p>The young men and the old men, too, who go out
"between acts" to hold spirit seances with neighboring
bar-keepers, while the orchestra is playing a Strauss
waltz or a medley of comic opera numbers for the
solace of the lovely ladies they have left behind them,
are a greater nuisance to the audience of a first-class
theatre than one would imagine. In nine cases out of
ten, the man who goes out to see another man, as the
saying is, has his seat in the middle of a row, so that it
is necessary for him to make trouble for ten or a
dozen persons before he can reach the aisle. He
tramples on ladies' dresses, comes into collision with
their knees, and sends a thrill of pain to the utmost
ends of the roots of every man's corn he treads on.
The same thing is repeated on the way back to his seat,
and there are bitter mutterings, a great deal of subdued
or smothered profanity, and fierce, rebuking looks
flash from beneath the beautiful bonnets of the females.
It doesn't seem to affect the nuisance any, however, for
he does the same thing over every act, and at each repetition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
increases to the damage he does and the commotion
he creates. Then, to make bad worse, he
manages to surround himself with a distillery odor that
assails feminine nostrils in a most offensive manner, and
that will not suffer itself to be concealed or tempered
by the chewing of coffee-grounds, cloves, or orange-peel.
I witnessed the discomfiture of a young man of this
kind, one night, and the scene was a very funny one.
He occupied a seat in the orchestra, in the centre of a
row of seats principally filled with ladies. As the curtain
went down the young man determined to go over
and have a look through the saloon opposite. Unwilling
to incommode the ladies in the least, the young
man, with Chesterfieldian grace, elevated a pedal extremity
over the back of his chair, with the intention
of going out through the aisle behind. Unfortunately
he stepped between the seat and the back, the movable
seat flew up, and the thirsty young man was left astride
of the chair in a decidedly uncomfortable position.
By this time the gallery gods had marked him
for their victim. They hooted, whistled, cat-called,
and made slang remarks about straddling the "ragged
edge," to his evident discomfiture. In vain he attempted
to disengage his No. 10's. The rest of the
audience became interested, and opera-glasses were
directed toward the blushing young man. The
feminine giggles in his neighborhood rendered him
frantic; laughter and uproar were becoming general,
when a good-natured individual kindly assisted him to
escape from his awkward position. Amid "thunders
of applause" he disappeared.</p>

<p>The ladies, too, sometimes contribute largely to the
annoyance of an audience. They are, as everybody
knows, inveterate talkers, and insist on saying almost
as much during a performance as the players say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Their criticism of the toilets of friends and of strangers
also, is loud-sweeping and usually denunciatory,
and they have a style of pillorying their victims in
speech that is decidedly heartless, yet refreshing. But
all the faults of loud and untamed talk might have
been forgiven had they not introduced the tremendous
big hats which
rise high above
their heads and
stick far out
from their ears
completely
shutting off a
view of the
stage from the
persons immediately
in the
rear. Strong
men have shed
tears to find themselves conquered by these big hats;
they have tried to peep around them, and have stood
tip-toed on their chairs to have a glance over the tops
of the millinery structures, but in vain. The hats
were too much for them. In a mild, æsthetic way the
ladies' big hats rank among the greatest plagues that
have ever visited the modern play-house.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE BIG HAT.</div></div>

<p>I was in the Grand Opera House at St. Louis, one
evening, sitting in seat No. 3, row B, centre section,
parquette circle. Before the play began two ladies,
one dressed in black silk with a white satin jacket and
black beaver hat, with long sweeping feather, and the
other plainly dressed in black cashmere, with a "Sensation"
hat and tassel on, came in and took seats 1
and 2 in row A, same section. Prior to settling down
in their places, they looked inquiringly around the rear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
of the theatre, one remarking to the other as they
plumped down in the chairs, "I suppose they haven't
got here yet." Seats three and four adjoining them
were vacant. The ladies had come unattended.
After they had arranged themselves the lady with the
beaver hat drew out a letter and held it up to the light
so that the reporter could read it. It had a cut of one
of the principal hotels at the top and was note-paper
from that establishment. It <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">To Mamie and Sadie</span>: Your note of to-day received.
We like your style and enclose two seats for
Grand Opera House to-night, where we hope to meet
you both and make your acquaintance.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Yours sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">George and Harry</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Just as the orchestra began the overture in walked
two gentlemen whom the usher showed to the vacant
seats in row A. One of the men was tall, bald, portly
and rather good-looking and well dressed; he had a
sandy moustache, and what hair was left on his head
was reddish, crisp, and curly. He was probably forty-five
years old. His companion was probably not more
than twenty-one, tall, thin, dark-complexioned, with
but a semblance of a moustache. The ladies smiled as
the gentlemen took their places. The men looked at
each other, winked, and laughed. When the two were
seated, the bald-headed man made a close and evidently
satisfactory scrutiny of the ladies, and catching
the eye of the one in the beaver hat, the two exchanged
smiles&mdash;not broad, committal grins, but soft smiles
of mutual recognition. The second lady only dared
to look sideways now and then. The second gentleman,
who sat next to the ladies, was rather shy and
kept his hand up to his face from beginning to end of
the play. It was evident this was the first time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
quartette had met, and it was evident also that they had
made up their minds to act with all due decorum while
in the theatre. Smiles were now and then exchanged,
but no words were spoken. Once one of the ladies
sent her programme to the bald man, who had none.
During the third act of the play the baldhead began
writing short notes which the lady in the beaver
hat answered affirmatively with a nod of her head.
When the show was over the two ladies went
around one street, the two men around another,
and they met in the middle of the block
opposite the theatre. There was a brief conversation
in which a great deal of tittering was heard, and
then the quartette
proceeded
to a quiet restaurant
of the
most questionable
reputation
and took one
of the private
supper-rooms,
which are at
the disposal of
people whose
visit to the establishment
is
not by any
means for the
sole purpose of
drinking and
eating, but has
a broad and very unmistakable suggestion of immorality
in it.</p>

<p>George and Harry had received an answer to this
advertisement from "Mamie and Sadie," and, just to
meet and become acquainted with them, had purchased
the four seats in row A, centre section, Grand Opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
House, making the theatre their place of assignation.
"Mamie and Sadie" were by no means the innocent
and unsophisticated creatures they seemed to be.
One of them was the wife of a travelling man who was
necessarily away from home ten months in a year; the
other was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nymph du pave</i>&mdash;a street-walker&mdash;who
scoured the principal thoroughfares at night for victims
to carry to her "furnished room," and who had
been educated up to the "personal" racket by the
lonely and wayward young wife of the commercial
drummer.</p>

<p>So much for the noisy, otherwise obtrusive phases
of the subject. The ladies who go to the theatre to
display themselves, to flash their jewels and flaunt
their silks and laces in the faces of the community,
have become so accustomed to the general run of
theatrical attractions that they are really no longer
spectators, and may be justly classed among the distracting
agencies in the audience. Their mission is a
"mashing" one to a certain extent, but it is "mashing"
of a vain and by no means harmful character.
Other ladies are seen in the dress circle and the boxes
who do not disguise the fact that they have come to
the theatre to fascinate the too, too yielding men. At
the matinees there are women of questionable repute
who unblushingly advertise their calling and who must
be set down as a feature most objectionable to the
respectable portion of any community. They behave
themselves as far as words or actions go, but their
mere presence in the play-house is an annoyance that
refined and elegant people cannot tolerate. That is all
about them. Now for the very worst practices that
are occasionally noted in theatres, and that the managers
know very little if anything about,&mdash;the women
who are there for nefarious purposes, and the men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
have other ideas than gratifying their vanity or merely
making heart-conquests. It is a notorious and flagrant
fact that fast women use the theatre as places of assignation,
wherein they meet old and make new acquaintances,
and it is equally notorious that men whose
whole energy seems bent to the distruction of innocent
girlhood make it a rendezvous for the purpose of
selecting and snaring their victims.</p>

<p>It is perfectly safe to assume that the cunning and
sinful pair fleeced George and Harry before they got
through with them.</p>

<p>The very same evening my attention was called by
a young lady to a thinly-bearded, spectacled, sickly-looking
middle-aged man who sat in the next seat to
the lady, and who, she complained, had stepped on her
foot several times and in other ways tried to attract
her attention and get her into a conversation. I at
once recognized the fellow as one of an unscrupulous
set who pored over big ledgers in the Court-House, and
gave the greater portion of their time to discussions
concerning female friends of ill-repute, and to boasting
of the ruin they had brought or were about to bring
to some innocent young girl.</p>

<p>The same man was in the habit of buying single
seats in the dress circle and visited the theatre frequently.
He represents a class of venerable, but
iniquitous fellows who make a practice of mixing in
among the ladies, in the hope of scraping an occasional
acquaintance, and who have no good intention
in desiring to extend the circle of their female friends.
They should be kept out of every respectable place of
amusement.</p>

</div>

<p>My first experiences behind the scenes were in a
small, dark cellar, owned by a man who is now a member
of the Missouri Legislature, and where daily and
nightly a select company of would-be Ethiopian comedians
of tender age gave performances to small crowds
of children each of whom had paid an admission fee in
pins or corks&mdash;for we valued the corks highly as a
necessary portion of our stock in trade; we charred
many a one to blacken our faces and treasured them as
if they were worth their weight in gold. Our stage
was roughly constructed of boards laid upon barrels;
bagging material hung around the rear and sides of
the stage to shut in the mysteries of the remarkable
dressing-room we had, and an old gray cloth and
blanket formed the curtain which parted in the middle
in the manner of the stage curtains of the Elizabethan
age. Bits of candles were our foot-lights and the audience,
made up of boys and girls, were satisfied to sit
for hours on rude benches stretched across the width
of the cellar. We played nothing but black-face
pieces, and as they were not taken from books, but
were the memories of sketches we had seen in some
pretentious theatrical resort, they were, of course, short
and entirely crude. No member of that little band
has risen to greatness in the theatrical profession, but
I think every one of them now living looks back
fondly to the triumphs of our cellar career. To me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
that rude stage and its gunny-bag surroundings were
more interesting and full of mystery than have been any
of the wonderful and beautiful temples of Thespis
which I have since entered; and I think when I played
the part of <i>Ephraim</i> in some ludicrous sketch, and in
response to the old man's cries from the stage, "Ephraim!
Ephraim! say boy, whar is you?" and I got
up suddenly in the rear of the audience and shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
back, "Hyar I is, boss!"&mdash;when this supreme moment
arrived, and the crowd looked back surprised and
laughed, the glow of conscious pride and artistic
power that filled my heart was as genuinely agreeable
as the thunders of applause that greet Booth or John
McCullough when their admirers call them before the
curtain after a great act.</p>

<p>I have only a dim recollection of my first introduction
to the professional stage. The fairy spectacle of
"Cherry and Fair Star" was running at a local theatre,
with Robert McWade, of recent Rip Van Winkle fame,
and Miss Wallace in the cast. By some good or bad
fortune I happened to be loitering in the neighborhood
of the back door of the theatre, when the captain of
the supers called me and hired me at twenty-five cents
a night to go on as imp in one of the spectacular
scenes. I was on hand promptly, and shall never
forget my wonder and astonishment at getting a first
glimpse of the secrets of the stage. It was almost
pitch dark when the back door was entered, and there
was nothing in the place at all suggestive of the glamour
that the foot-lights throw upon the scene. Huge clouds
of black canvas rose upon all sides, and men and boys
in the dirtiest of workday clothes were the only persons
met. The noise of hammer and saw rose on various
sides, and it seemed as if the stage had not been
one-half prepared for the play that the curtain would
ring up on within an hour. The dressing-room in which
fifty or sixty boys were arraying themselves looked
like the interior of a costume establishment after a
cyclone had passed through it. But when all were
dressed, and the fairies and the goblins assembled in
the "wings," and the foot-lights were turned up and
the orchestra outside was rattling through some inspiring
air, the small boy in impish raiment was immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
wrapt into a seventh heaven of delight.
There was a multitude of girls in very low-necked and
short dresses with glowing flesh-colored tights that
seemed such inadequate covering for the rounded
limbs that blushing was inevitable. The bright colors
in their cheeks, the blackly outlined eyes and the
blonde wigs added to the interest of the new charms.
Every bit of glorious color in the gorgeous scenery appeared
to flash out amid the flood of light. I ran
against every variety of demon that was ever known
to M.&nbsp;D. Conway, and was pushed out of the way of a
hundred persons only to find myself obstructing somebody
else's progress. The magnificent revelations of
that night filled me with awe and astonishment for
many a week afterward. It was the only night I appeared
as an imp, for I had accepted the engagement
without parental knowledge or consent, and when they
learned of my success they at once put a decided and
impressive veto upon any further efforts in the direction
of the professional stage.</p>

<p>That first experience was not, of course, as abundant
in opportunities for observation as later experiences
have been. The world behind the foot-lights&mdash;the
mimic world as it is called&mdash;is a realm of the
most startling and pleasing kind. Not only is there
food for wonder in what the eye falls upon, but the
people who furnish the fun for the world are often
among themselves as prolific of pleasantry as if they
expected the applause of a full house to follow their
jokes. They say and do the strangest things, and for
a visitor who is investigating the mysteries of their
surroundings, often make the time as lively and the
surroundings as enjoyable as it is possible for really
clever and good-natured people to do. The best time
to go behind the scenes is during the engagement of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>burlesque or comic opera company, and I will introduce
the reader to a happy crowd of this kind that I
once found myself in.</p>

<p>In 1879 the Kiralfys brought out their spectacular
burlesque entitled "A Trip to the Moon," and I had
the pleasure, during its run, of dropping in behind the
scenes of a Western theatre one night to have a peep at
the pictures there presented. Now, the moon is
something like two hundred and eighty thousand miles
from here&mdash;that is the one reputed to be made of
green cheese, and having phases as numerous as the
occasions that ring the April skies with rainbows.
But the Kiralfys' moon was in another firmament,
shining out amid stars that, when they wink their
twinkling eyes or shuffle their shining feet, as they do
frequently, the celestial shiners have got to put on
their cloud ulsters, and sit down while the lachrymose
eyes of the heavens give up their tears. That is why
it was raining torrents the night I went behind the
scenes with Mr. Bolossy Kiralfy. As I went in the
back door <i>Prof. Microscope</i>, one of the funny characters
in the play, brushed by with a telescope under his
arm that was large enough to put Lord Ross's famous
spy-glass into its vest pocket, if it had one. The
moon to which the trip was to be made was not so far
as two hundred and eighty thousand miles by a half
block or so, but it was a very funny world, full of gaslight
and laughter, and with the most mirthful sports
imaginable on its glowing surface. I was inclined
somewhat to lunar ways, and thinking like a great
many other credulous mortals, that the trans-atmospheric
trip was really made in a cartridge-built coach
that was fired out of a huge mortar at the rate of about
eighteen thousand six hundred and sixty-six and two-thirds
miles a minute, had fully made up my mind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
ride on the roof or cow-catcher of the concern, at whatever
risks to life and limb space might abound in. I
expected to find something like a solid space-annihilating
Columbiad behind the scenes, but I was somewhat
mistaken.</p>

<p>Just before the curtain was rung up I found myself
in the midst of the fairy world upon which the brilliancy
of the foot-light falls. While the curtain was still
down, and before the gasman had opened the floodgates
of splendor, the place was dark; not pitch dark,
but pretty dark, compared with the brilliancy that
shown in, over, and around its space a few minutes
later. And then its intricacies, pieces of scenery here,
various properties there, and sections of everything
and anything scattered anywhere and everywhere,
made a fellow feel as if the place was darker than it
really was. Glittering and glowing as the stage
appears before the foot-lights; wonderfully romantic as
are its shades and lights, its love and laughter; and
astounding as are its scenic effects; its area and surroundings
are terribly realistic when the foot-lights are
left behind, and the "business" of a play is once laid
bare. Here the sighs of love-sick maidens and the
spooning of gilt-edged but uncourageous wooers, the
tears of injured innocence and the self-gratulations of
hard-hearted villains who still pursue the flying female,
the prattle of young mouths and the mumblings of
"old men" and "old women," are lost with the
departed scenes of the play in the unceasing desire of
the actors to get back into their proper social and
friendly relations to each other, and, once the prompter's
book is closed, stage talk and stage manner are
under metaphoric lock and key, and romance is for a
while at an end.</p>

<p>On opera bouffe or burlesque nights, however, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
great deal of the stage charm clings to the characters
even when off the stage, and one is compelled to be
interested in the grotesqueness of those to be met in
the side scenes&mdash;the odd and often pretty creatures
who stand, sit, lie or lean around in the "wings" at
their own sweet leisure and pleasure. There is something
so indescribably funny in the costumes, in the
facial make-up, and all that, of the happy opera-bouffer
or festive burlesquer, that the eye follows a quaint
character through the scenes with the same inalienable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
interest as that with which the small boy hovers around
the heels of an Italian with a hand-organ and a monkey.
The eye, however, must not, cannot linger or languish
long upon a single one of these walking wardrobes.
There is a moving panorama constantly in front of the
surprised vision, and before an electric flash could
photograph one single individual in his droll toggery
there would be a dozen or more "shassaying" before
the camera.</p>

<p>There was leaning against one of the "wings" a
<i>naive</i> and sprightly piece of feminine beauty, set off in
the handsomest and most enticing manner in the world
by a well-rounded, gracefully curved pair of pink
tights, a white satin surtout and mantelet, plentifully
besprent with glittering braid and flashing beads,
dainty silk slippers that would have made a Chinese
princess weep with envy, and a jaunty white hat to
match. She was, of course, to figure as the charming
little hero of the evening, if burlesques can be said to
have such things as heroes. A doughty old chap,
with bristling hair and a porcupine moustache,
was standing by talking to little pink tights. He was
gotten up like a circus poster in forty colors, with a
plentiful array of red on his head and legs and a sort
of sickly-looking, rainbow-sandwich built about his
body. Red, blue and black streaks straying over his
features made it appear as if he might have been assigned
the role of an ogre and was accustomed to
nightly look around for his fair companion to make a
meal of her. I immediately made friends with the comic
horror and the little lady in pink tights and learned
who and what they were. The latter was (in the play,
of course) a nobby young blood known as <i>Prince
Caprice</i>, personated by Miss Alice Harrison; the red-legged
comedian was <i>King Pin</i>, the young <i>Prince's</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
funny father and Mr. Louis Harrison was hidden
under the remarkable royal disguise.</p>

<p>"Well, when are we going to start for the moon?"
I asked, good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"In a few fleeting moments," was the regal dough-belly's
reply.</p>

<p>"And are all these folks going into the projectile?"
pointing to the crowd of curious characters passing and
repassing us.</p>

<p>"Not if the court knows herself and she thinks she
does," put in the <i>Prince</i>, pertly; "only the <i>King</i>,
<i>Prof. Microscope</i> and myself ride in the cab."</p>

<p><i>Prof. Microscope</i> was a long, scrawny fellow. He
was twirling a shaggy moustache and buzzing a handsome
and not at all bashful ballet girl at the same
time, a short distance away. He was gotten up in a
blue-striped, swallow-tail coat, long enough, if the
<i>Professor</i> cared about lending or renting it out, to be
used for a streamer on the City Hall flagstaff, and
short enough in the back to have the waist-buttons
constantly challenging the collar to a prize fight or
wrestling match. Very tight black pants, a luxuriantly
frilled shirt front, fluted cuffs, and white hair
allowed to grow to the length worn by Buffalo Bill, completed
his outfit. When I was introduced to him, the
<i>Professor</i> swore by the bones of Copernicus's grandmother
on a volume of patent office reports that he
was the sole originator and engineer of the only direct
moon line, and he'd bet his boots or eat his hat that it
never took more than fifteen minutes to make the
trip.</p>

<p>"You see," said <i>King Pin</i>, "that <i>Microscope</i> is a
queer fellow&mdash;not a coney man, you mind."</p>

<p>"Although," said the <i>Prince</i>, "he now and then
casts his lot on the turn of the die."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
"Yes, his lot of last year's clothing," the jolly
<i>King</i> remarked, "on the turn of the dyer."</p>

<p>This effort resulted in six of the supers, who were
gotten up in voluminous dominoes with elaborate, but
inexpensive, pasteboard trimmings, and who were within
hearing distance, falling stiff and stark to the stage.</p>

<p>"Does this kind of thing occur often?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh," growled the <i>Professor</i>, "that gag was
stuffed and on exhibition at the Centennial. It was
found in an Indian mound near Memphis, and is old."</p>

<p>And so the talk went on for a while, when up went
the curtain and <i>King Pin</i> leaping on the stage amidst the
laughter and plaudits of the house, told how the pretty
<i>Prince Caprice</i> had tired of mundane things and was
heavily sighing for the fountain-head of the lambent
silvery moonlight. <i>Microscope</i>, who was at the head
of the Royal College of Astronomers, was besought to
do something to aid the <i>Prince</i> in accomplishing the
journey to Merrie Moonland, and in a neat speech unfolded
his plans for a grand dynamo-etherial line that
would speedily carry the <i>Prince</i> to the wished-for
happy Land of Luna.</p>

  <div class="caption sans">PAULINE MARKHAM.</div></div>

<p>Then came the glorious moment when the flight
moonwards was to be made. I hurried around to the
prompter's side of the stage where I saw the mouth of
the huge cannon gaping, and got there as they were
about to fire it. Imagine my surprise to find the extraordinary
piece of ordnance made entirely of pasteboard,
a substance that a few grains of gunpowder would blow
into as many pieces as the leaves of Vallambrosia.
Still the passengers were to be fired out of this contrivance,
and I felt that if they and the cannon could
stand it, it was none of my business. It had all been
explained to the audience, that <i>King Pin</i>, <i>Prince
Caprice</i> and <i>Prof. Microscope</i> were the only three persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
to be given seats in the cartridge-cab in which the
wonderful journey was to be made. The question
therefore naturally arose, what was to become of the
multitude of characters that crowded the "wings."
There were "supers" in black, yellow and mottled
dominoes with high <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">papier-maché</i> casques, and huge
ear-trimmings that reminded one of the flaps that
decorate the sides of a Chicago girl's head, or the sails
of a lake lumberman. There were star-gazers with
zodiacal garments and tin telescopes, all set off by
great pairs of soda-bottle-lens eye-glasses, that gave
them the air of a Secchi, or somebody else of astronomical
aspect. There were guards who shouldered
tooth brushes made entirely of wood, with index hands
surmounting the tops of their chapeaux and serving to
indicate that their intellects had gone moon-hunting;
and there were other creatures, among them, horrible
genii, who started for the moon by some short route
across lots and got there long before the regular excursionists.</p>

<p>But the corps de ballet! It was everything but a
beauty. If there is anything likely to strike a theatre-goer
as ludicrous, it is an awkward squad of over-grown
girls, with gauze-garnished limbs and dissipated-looking
blonde wigs. A precocious ballet-debutante is a
bit of Dead-Sea fruit shot backward off Terpsichore's
head, and if the bullet does not lay Terpsichore herself
out in a first-class undertaker's style it is because
Terpsichore happens to be in terribly good luck.
These reflections were suggested by a sight of the
intermingling danseuses that kept pretty well in the
rear of the stage. You could tell the height to which
each one could safely fling her foot on looking at her.
The girl who was making her first appearance had not
yet gotten over her splayfootedness, and every time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
she took a peep at the audience and began to realize
the airiness of her costume and gawkiness of her manners,
her knees knocked together fast enough to keep
a few notes ahead of her chattering teeth. And her
dress! there was nothing marvellous about it&mdash;nothing
that would carry a person off into the ideal financial
realms of a national debt. It was powerfully
plain with a stiff and provoking effort at showiness.
The next line, who also may be classed as figurantes,
are plainly to be distinguished by their natty air of
sauciness and a noticeable clipping-off of the super-abundant
clothing that encumbers the latest additions
to the corps. The coryphees, though, are radiant in
glittering, close-fitting silver mail, and there is acquired
grace in their actions, and a high haughtiness
in the toss of their heads. The premieres everybody
understands and recognizes, who has once seen them
pirouette on their toes or slam around in a wild
ecstasy of dancing delight that would give anybody
else a vertigo and lead to numerous and possibly serious
dislocations. Well, all these were whispering or
prattling together, in the way of the scene-shifters,
who went around reckless of their language, with
sleeves rolled up and anxious faces and questioning
eyes turned upon all whom they encountered there.
It struck me, as I gazed upon this almost naked and
highly interesting ballet, that if the moon had no
atmosphere, as those who know best claim, the costumes
of these gay and giddy girls were airy enough
to stock it with a pretty extensive and healthy one.
Out of this jumble of scenery and from the midst of
these jostling characters the start was made for the
moon. There was no carriage, no cartridge, no load
in the cannon. Her trip as a trip was a most undisguised
and diaphanous fraud. While <i>King Pin</i>, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span><i>Prince</i>, the <i>Professor</i>, and the rest were arranging
themselves in a happy tableau behind the second "flat"
bang! went a gun fired by one of the supers, across
the stage flew several "dummies" or stuffed figures
in the direction of the roof, the scene opened and lo
the jolly crowd were in Moonland. <i>King Pin</i>, <i>Prince
Caprice</i> and <i>Microscope</i> were there together, as fresh
and fair as if they were accustomed to making two-hundred-and-eighty-thousand-mile
trips. The monarch
of the moon, <i>King Kosmos</i> (W.&nbsp;A. Mestayer),
after having summoned his retinue of Selenites&mdash;the
same long-robed, pillow-stomached and pasteboard-eared
crew who had died behind the scenes a few minutes
before from an over-stroke of punning&mdash;and
having things explained to everybody's satisfaction,
came forward and fell on the several necks of the terrestrial
visitors, was punched in the paunch, by the
<i>King</i>, enough times to set all the Moonites into roars
of laughter, and then they all joined in stretching their
necks and rasping their throats in a welcoming chorus
to their guests.</p>

  <div class="caption">ADAH ISAAC MENKEN.</div></div>

<p>It was unfortunate for the visitors that <i>King Kosmos</i>
had a beautiful little princess of a daughter called
<i>Fantasia</i> (Miss Gracie Plaisted), with a voice that rippled
and rolled in music, earthly as the bulbul's notes
and celestial as the songs of the spheres; and, of course,
foolish little <i>Caprice</i> had to go and fall in love with
her and sing innumerable sweet songs to her, all of
which only got poor old <i>Pin</i> and his friends into all
sorts of trouble. This they finally managed to get out
of by returning to mother earth in a gorgeously-appointed
flying ship, as grand as Cleopatra's galley.
Before decamping, however, Moonland was visited in
every part, and its gardens of silver-tinged foliage, its
crystal palaces, that made pale Luna's light more brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
still, its icy mountains with mass of frostage,
in and about which the ballet wound in the graceful
rhythm of "Les Flocons de Niege," were all taken in,
and notwithstanding an occasional hitch in getting the
panorama around, everything in this new and gleaming
sphere was really glorious for a first-night visit.</p>

<span class="subhead">IN THE DRESSING-ROOM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>These same people who appear grotesque, and out
of the pale of ordinary every-day existence on the
stage, are nearly always the most unromantic and realistic-looking
folks in the world when you meet them on
the street. The extraordinary metamorphosis they go
through to arrive at an appearance suitable for presentation
before the foot-lights is a secret of the dressing-room.
In the privacy of this carefully guarded
apartment street clothes are laid aside, and what is
more wonderful still, faces, eyes, and hands and lower
limbs, too, very frequently, are subjected to processes
that produce the most remarkable results. Anybody
who has seen Nat Goodwin, of "Hobbies" reputation,
will readily understand that it takes a pretty extensive
transformation to change his appearance from that of
the man to that of <i>Prof. Pygmalion Whiffles</i>, the
eccentric character that makes "Hobbies" the laughable
and popular play that it is. Mr. Goodwin is
young&mdash;not more than twenty-four&mdash;but I saw him
slip out of his youthfulness into the bald-headed, red-wigged
and merry old professor one night in almost as
short a time as it takes a boy to fall through a four-story
elevator shaft. I accompanied him to his dressing-room
one night. He had just a few minutes to get
ready, and was in proper shape in time to make his
appearance at the upper entrance, amid the crash that
always accompanies his first appearance in the play,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
and gives him an opportunity to make some remarks
about <i>Maj. Bang's</i> dog, which has ripped his "ulster"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
up the back. Well, Goodwin went to work the
moment he was inside the door. Off came the everyday
clothes, and in a jiffy on went the one white and
black stocking that will be remembered by all who
have seen "Hobbies." The shirt, coat, pantaloons,
linen duster and hat that forms the rest of his toilet,
were carefully laid upon a side table. The shirt was
flapped over his head in a second, the pantaloons went
on like lightning and then bending towards a looking-glass
he dipped his fingers in red and black color
boxes, and soon had the necessary painting done upon
his face. The velvet coat followed the making-up of
the face; then the torn linen duster, finally the red wig
with its charming bald spot, was clapped upon his
head; the white hat was gracefully tilted over it, and
with a call to the man who played <i>Arthur Doveleigh</i>
for his cane and an "I'll see you later" to his visitor,
he bounded up the stairs, and the next moment, as I
left the stage door, I could hear the hand-clapping and
the howls of delight with which a crowded house was
greeting their favorite.</p>

  <div class="caption">BALLET GIRLS DRESSING-ROOM.</div></div>

<p>The great value of the art of making-up, as the
preparation for participation in a play is called, both
in the matter of painting the face and costuming, will
be understood when the story told by Maze Edwards,
who was Edwin Booth's manager during the tour of
1881&ndash;2, is recited. * * * The company got to
Waterbury, Connecticut, ahead of their baggage.
When the hour for the performance arrived the baggage,
consisting of all their costumes and paraphernalia
was still missing. The manager was in a terrible
plight; but I will let him tell his own story as he told
it to a newspaper reporter a short time after the occurrence.</p>

<div id="ip_21" class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">
  <img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="333" height="384" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">EDWIN BOOTH.</div></div>

<p>"When I found the baggage, with the costumes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
had not arrived," said Edwards, "I was just going to
throw myself into the river. Then I thought I would
go and tell Mr. Booth about it and bid good-bye to
some of the people who had always thought a good
deal of me, before killing myself. To my astonishment
Mr. Booth took it as coolly as you would take an
invitation to drink. He said, inasmuch as the people
were in the hall, he would make a few remarks to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
about the accident, and then they would go on and
play three acts of "Hamlet" in the clothes they had
on. And so it was fixed up that way. Well, the
thought of <i>Hamlet</i> in a short-tailed coat and light
pants almost made me sick, and when Mr. Booth came
upon the stage, looking like an Episcopal minister,
with a Knight Templar's cheese knife that he borrowed,
I couldn't think of anything but <i>Hamlet</i>. I
forgot all about his clothes, and I believe if he had
only had on a pair of sailor's pants and a red flannel
fireman's shirt that the people would only have seen
<i>Hamlet</i>. I tell you he is the greatest actor that ever
lived. The people sat perfectly still, and seemed
wrapped up in Booth. That is, they were when they
did not look at the other fellows. But when they took
<i>Laertes</i>, with a short, ham-fat coat on, a pair of lah-de-dah
pants and a pan-cake hat, it seemed to me I
could hear them smile. And the <i>King</i>, <i>Hamlet's</i> step-father,
he was a sight. Imagine a king with a cut-away
checkered coat, a Pullman car blanket thrown
over his shoulder for a robe, and a leg of a chair for a
sceptre, mashed on a queen with a travelling dress and
a gray woollen basque with buttons on it. And think
of <i>Polonius</i>, with a linen duster and a straw hat with a
blue ribbon on. Oh, it made me tired. <i>Ophelia</i> was
all right enough. She had on some crazy clothes that
she had been travelling in, and we got some straw out
of a barn and some artificial flowers off the bonnets,
and she pulled through pretty well. But the <i>Ghost</i>!
You would have died to have seen the <i>Ghost</i>. He had
on one of those long hand-me-down ulster overcoats
with a buckle on the back as big as a currycomb and the
belt was hanging down on both sides. The boys got
him a green mosquito bar to put over it, and with a
stuffed club for a sceptre, he fell over a chair and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
came on. I should have laughed if I had been on my
death-bed when he said to <i>Hamlet</i>, 'I am thy father's
ghost!' He looked more like a drummer for a wholesale
confectionery house, with a sort of tin skimmer
on his head, and I believe the audience would have
gone wild with laughter if it had not been for Mr.
Booth. I don't believe you could get him to laugh on
the stage for a million dollars. He just looked at the
<i>Ghost</i> as though it was a genuine one, and the audience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
looked at Booth, and forgot all about the ulster and
the <i>Ghost's</i> pants being rolled up at the bottom. It
was probably the greatest triumph that an actor ever
had for Mr. Booth to compel the vast audience to forget
the ludicrous surroundings and think only of the
character he was portraying. I wouldn't have missed
the night's performance for a thousand dollars, and
when, at 10 o'clock, I heard the boys getting the
trunks up-stairs, I was almost sorry. The last two
acts were played with the costumes, but they were no
better performed than the first. Still, I think, on the
whole, I had rather the baggage would be there. It
makes a manager feel better."</p>

<p>In the olden times, and in the days of the early
American theatre, the dressing-rooms were beneath
the stage, and were by no means the perfect and cozy
places that are to be found in existence at present.
Hodgkinson, I think it was, who, during the last century
built the first theatre having dressing-rooms above
and upon the stage. Later improvement has removed
the dressing-rooms, in first-class houses, entirely from
the stage, ample and neatly-furnished rooms being
provided in adjoining buildings. This change has been
necessitated by the demand made upon theatrical managers
for greater stage room and better opportunities
than they had heretofore in keeping up with the growing
taste for extensive scenic representations with
magnificent appointments. The star of a company,
male or female, always has the best dressing-room the
establishment affords, and it is generally very close to
the green-room. Minor performers share their rooms;
and the captain of the supers usually has an apartment
beneath the stage where he gathers his Roman
mob, or marshals his mail-clad but awkward squad of
warriors. No better burlesque upon this ill-clothed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
dirty-faced, knock-kneed and ridiculous theatrical contingent
has ever been presented either in type or on
the stage, than the character of the Roman Lictor
created by Louis Harrison in San Francisco, and afterwards
relegated to another performer in "Photos."
The story is told that Harrison having been cast for
the part of a lictor in a tragedy in which John McCullough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
took the leading role, he grew offended, having
higher aspirations than mere utility business, and determined
to make the part funny and, if possible, spoil
the scene. When he came on the stage, he was in war-paint,
his face strewn with gory colors and intermingling
black; he had on the dirtiest costume he could
find, with a battered rusty helmet, and carried the
insignia of his office so awkwardly, while his knees
came together his toes turned in, and his general attitude
was that of a man in the third week of a hard
spree. He brought the house down, spoiled the play
and was discharged for making too much of a success
of the part. But this is a digression, and we must
hurry back to the dressing-room.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of the actor's work preliminary
to going on the stage is to make-up his face.
By the judicious use of powder and paint, and a proper
disposition of wigs, beard, etc., the oldest man may
be made to assume juvenility and the youngest to
seem to bend with the weight of years. Wigs are to
a great extent reliable, but the old fashioned false
beard is clumsy and apt to make the wearer feel dissatisfied
with himself and the rest of the world. But
the old fashioned beard is going out of style, and gray
wool stuck on the face with grease is generally used.
I can recall vividly how a beard of this sort worn by
poor George Conly, the basso, while singing the part
of <i>Gaspard</i> in "The Chimes of Normandy," while
with the Emma Abbot troupe last season, struck me
as the perfection of deception. It always requires a
dresser to put on one of these beards in anything like
a satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>An old actor of the "crushed" type who has been
almost forced off the stage and into running a dramatic
college, by the young and pushing element in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
the profession, in an interview had with him lately in
Philadelphia, remarked, as he looked with evident interest
upon the crowds in the street: "I like to study
faces. To my mind it is the most absorbing study in
the world&mdash;that of men's faces. You see, the thing
has more interest for me than for the run of men even
in my profession, because I'm an enthusiast in a certain
sense. I belong to the times when the study and
make-up of faces was mighty important in the theatrical
line. It wasn't such a long time ago, either; but
the times have changed since then, until now there
seems to be almost no effort at all to make-up and
look your part."</p>

<p>"It must be a great deal of trouble to make up
every night."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, my boy, look at the result! Go down to
the theatre, where they still do it, and if only five
years have elapsed between the acts, see how it is
shown on every face on the stage."</p>

<p>"It is difficult to make-up well, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Well, no," said the actor, lighting a fresh cigar
and assuming a more confidential pose, "the rules
are simple enough, and with a little practice, almost
any amateur could learn to make up artistically if he
has any eye for effect. Some parts, like <i>Romeo</i>,
<i>Charles Surface</i>, <i>Sidney Darrell</i> or <i>Claude Melnotte</i>,
require very little make up for a young and good-looking
actor. The face and neck should be thoroughly
covered with white powder, and the cheek bones
and chin lightly touched with rouge, which should not
be too red. Then, as the lover ought to look handsome,
he should draw a fine black line under his lower eye-lashes
with a camel hair brush and burnt umber.
This makes the eyes brilliant. I'm sure it isn't much
trouble to make up that way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_24" class="figcenter" style="width: 287px;">
  <img src="images/i_096.jpg" width="287" height="468" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">SARAH BERNHARDT.</div></div>

<p>"Other characters are harder, though?"</p>

<p>"Oh, immeasurably so. But to make a maturer
man, like <i>Cassio</i>, <i>Iago</i>, <i>Mercutio</i>, <i>John Midway</i> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
<i>Hawksley</i>, it requires only a little more work. After
the actor has laid on his powder and rouged his face
pretty heavily&mdash;for men are commonly rather red-faced&mdash;he
must take his brush and umber and trace
some lines from the outer corners of the eyes, and
other lines down toward the corners of the mouth
from the nose. In short, he must make the 'crows'
feet that are visible in all men who have lived over
thirty years in this tantalizing world of ours. Then
the chin should be touched with a little blue powder,
which makes it look as if recently shaved. These precautions
will make the most juvenile face look mature.
If he has to go further, and look like old age, as in
such characters as <i>Lear</i>, <i>Virginius</i>,&mdash;for, as I said
before, <i>Virginius</i>, was an old man,&mdash;<i>Richelieu</i>, <i>Sir
Peter Teazle</i>, and so on, more work is necessary.
Heavy false eyebrows must be pasted on, and the eye-hollow
darkened and fairly crowded with lines.
Wrinkles must be painted across the forehead, furrows
down the cheeks, downward lines from the corners of
the mouth, and (very important) three or four heavy
wrinkles painted around the neck to give it the shriveled
appearance common to old age. The hollow
over the upper lip should be darkened, and also the
hollow under the lower lip. This gives the mouth
the pinched and toothless look. A little powdered
antimony on the cheeks makes them look fallen in and
shrunken. Then tone the face down with a delicate
coating of pearl powder, and you'll have as old a looking
man as you'd care to see."</p>

<p>"How does it feel?"</p>

<p>"At first your face feels tightened, and the muscles
don't play easily, but after a few grimaces it comes out
all right. It's a great relief to get off, however, after
three hours' work."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
"It must cause rather mournful forecasts when a
man looks on his own face made up for the age of,
say, eighty years."</p>

<p>"Not so bad as when he makes up for a corpse,
however. I'll never forget the first glance I had at
my face after it had been made up for <i>Gaston's</i> death
scene, when playing the "Man of the Iron Mask," in
'62. It positively appalled me, sir, and I lay awake
all that night thinking of it, and dreamed of myself
in a coffin for a month afterward."</p>

<p>"How is it done?"</p>

<p>"Well, it varies slightly. You see, such characters
as <i>Lear</i>, <i>Virginius</i>, <i>Werner</i>, and <i>Beverly</i> are before
the audience some time before they actually die, and
therefore, their faces cannot be made very corpse-like;
but <i>Mathias</i> in 'The Bells,' <i>Louis XI.</i>, <i>Gaston</i> and
<i>Danny Mann</i> are discovered dying when the scene
opens, or are brought in dead, so that their faces can
be made extreme. For the last series the face and
neck should be spread with prepared pink to give it a
livid hue in places. Then put a deep shading of powdered
antimony under the eyebrows and well into the
hollow of the eye, on the cheeks, throat and temples.
This is very effective, as it gives the face that dreadfully
sunken appearance as in death. The sides of the
nose and even the upper lip should also be darkened,
and the lips powdered blue. Then the face will look
about as dead as it would three hours after a real
death."</p>

<p>"In the make up of grotesque faces do they use
false noses and chins?"</p>

<p>"Very rarely. Usually the method is to stick some
wool on the nose with a gum and mold it in whatever
shape you will; then powder and paint it as you would
the natural nose for grotesque or comedy parts. Paste
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>is put on with gum, instead of wool, sometimes.
Clowns have to encase themselves fairly with whiting,
and they find this trouble enough without building up
noses or cheeks. Grotesque artists have to work hard
with their faces as a rule, but they are often repaid by
discovering neat points. Many of our best Dutch
and Irish comedians owe their first lift to a lucky
make-up."</p>

<p>"I suppose there are types of the representation of
different nationalities?"</p>

<p>"Well, a gentleman is usually made-up the same,
no matter where he may be supposed to belong, but
the caricature is usually one of the well-known make-ups.
A Frenchman has to be powdered with dark
rouge, and has his eyebrows blackened with dark ink.
All dark characters, as mulattoes, creoles, Spaniards,
and so on, are done with whiting and dark rouge, with
plenty of burnt cork and umber."</p>

<p>"Is much work necessary on the hands?"</p>

<p>"In witches it is of great importance that the hands
and arms should be skinny and bony. This is usually
done by a liberal powdering of Dutch pink, and painting
between the knuckles with burnt umber. Painting
between the knuckles, you see, makes them look
large and bony. But this sounds a good deal like
ancient history, now, does it not? The art is falling
into disuse, my boy, and I've no doubt the time is not
far off when we shall have youngsters playing old
men with signs on their back reading, 'Please, sir,
I'm eighty years old,' while their faces are as fresh as
daisies."</p>

<p>"To what do you attribute this tendency."</p>

<p>"Laziness. The theatrical age of to-day is a wonder
to me. The entire profession wants to star. An
actor plays old men now simply for a living, while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
matures his plans for his contemplated starring tour.
An actress does old women heavies or juveniles only
until she can find a capitalist who will enable her to
star, and none of them seem to take any pride in the
minor parts. Hence, they don't take the trouble to
make up artistically, and the stage is robbed of its chief
charm&mdash;realism."</p>

  <div class="caption">DRESSING AN ACTRESS' HAIR.</div></div>

<p>The looking-glass and the pots of paint and boxes of
powder upon the shelves of the dressing-room are as important
adjuncts of the play, and even more important,
sometimes, than the huge boxes and trunks filled with
costumes that are found in the same place. They hold
their place amid the diamond necklaces and brilliant
bracelets of the prima donna, the cheaper jewels of the
dramatic artiste and the crowns of kings and helmets
of warriors. Their power is great, and that power
is fully recognized by all who are within the domain
of dramatic art. And the actor or actress, the prima
donna and the swell tenor, all generally make it their
business to attend to their own beautification in this
way themselves. Nearly all star actors carry male
servants who are known as dressers, and all prominent
actresses have maids who accompany them to the
theatre and these help to complete the artiste's
toilets. Formerly there were barbers and hair-dressers,
as well as other specialists, attached to places
of amusement, and whose business it was to shave an
actor or dress a head of hair before the performance.
Many establishments retain these yet, but they are not
as numerous or as well-known as they were before the
days of travelling combinations. Apropos the theatrical
hair-dresser there is quite an interesting story told.
One of this class fell in love with a popular actress he
was frequently called upon to beautify. He confessed
his devouring passion on his knees and she laughed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>him to scorn. More than that, she insisted on his
continuing his ministrations to her and made him the
butt of her heartless gibes while he was devoting himself
to enhance her cruel loveliness. The iron entered
his soul and he swore vengeance. One night, when
he had to prepare her for a most important part, he
surpassed himself in the splendor of her crowning decoration.
Having finished he anointed her golden locks
with a compound of a peculiarly fascinating aromatic
odor, which so attracted his callous enslaver's notice
that she asked him what it was.</p>

<p>"It is a mixture of my own, Madame," he replied.
"I call it the last breath of love."</p>

<p>The actress remarked that she would call him a fool,
and he bowed and withdrew. A few minutes later,
when she appeared behind the foot-lights, instead of
the roar of applause which she expected, she was
hailed with a tempestuous scream of laughter. Her
discarded lover had had his revenge. He had dyed
her golden locks with a chemical which turned pea
green as soon as it was dry. She dresses what hair
she has left herself now, while he is boss of a five-cent
shaving emporium, never speaks to any lady but his
landlady, and has a Chinaman to do his washing.</p>

<p>If there is a ballet or a burlesque crowd or comic
opera chorus in the theatre the scenes in their rooms
will be of a more diversified nature. The girls in
addition to making their faces pretty, must have their
limbs so shapely that no fault can be found even by
the most cavilling of the gentlemen who crowd up
behind the orchestra while the house holds a host
of female attractions. The rage for limb exhibitions
rendered it necessary that some means should be
devised to hide the calves or poorly turned ankles of
the creatures whose limbs are displayed. Happily the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
symmetricals, as padded tights are called, were hit upon
and now you cannot find an unsightly piece of underpinning
in any combination, and even the poor ballet
girl who does page's parts or helps to make up a crowd
for $6 a week, will, if she has sense and taste, go early
to the dealer in theatrical goods and have symmetricals
made to suit the exigencies of her case. These
artistic accessories of feminine fictitiousness are leggings
or tights woven in such a manner the thickness of a
deficient thigh, the pipe-stem character of a calf, are
filled out with silk and cotton into shapefulness and
beauty that Venus de Medici herself would not be
ashamed to make a display of. I heard a story about
an operatic artist who for a long time refused to play
parts demanding the exhibition even of a fraction of a
limb, and all because her lower members were too
attenuated to attract anything else but ridicule. Lately
she has found her way to the pad-maker's and now can
present as pretty an ankle and as round a calf to the
audience as sister artists who have more flesh and
blood in their composition. Men as well as women
patronize the pad-maker and any actor of the mashing
persuasion who may have had to keep his bandy legs
in wide pantaloons heretofore can now burst forth
upon the sight of his adored in all the gorgeous loveliness
and perfection of an attractive anatomy.</p>

<p>The green-room, except where stock companies prevail&mdash;and
there are not more than three or four in the
United States now&mdash;has passed out of the shadow of
the rigorous rules that sometime ago were posted here,
and that had to be observed. By this I do not mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
that rules have been entirely done away with behind the
scenes; but travelling companies are governed by their
own rules, carry their own stage manager, prompter,
etc., and the only persons that local green-room rules
could apply to now-a-days would be the four or five
poorly paid young girls who, in their desire to go on
the stage and become stars, start and generally stay at
the bottom of the ladder, where they are paid pitiful
salaries and continue to "mash" wandering minstrels,
or the equally poorly paid and badly treated members
of some male chorus. These girls usually spend the
lengthy leisure a performance gives them sitting demurely
on chairs in the corner of the green-room until
the call-boy sends them word that they are needed to
fill up some silent gap in the entertainment. Beyond
these there are few to be found in the green-room during
a performance. Occasionally an actor will drop in
to pace the floor as he mumbles his lines over, or an
actress, who is tired from standing in the wings, or on
the stage, will hurry in and drop to rest on the sofa.
The side scenes, or "wings," as they are termed, are
the places in which to find almost everybody who has
any business around the stage of a theatre. Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>

  <div class="caption">GETTING THEIR "LINES."</div></div>

<p>Gathered together in the entrances and within easy
call of the prompter, whose business it has recently
become to mind everybody else's business, are the
performers, male and female mingling together, waiting
for their cue to go on. The absence of chairs makes
it necessary for all to remain on their feet, and only
when a friendly "property" that may be used for
sedentary purposes is within reach will a weary actor
or actress take possession of it. Enough has been
said already about the general aspect of affairs behind
the scenes and the groupings in the green-room. Now,
let us turn our attention to some of the individuals and
incidents of this remarkable little world. The stage
prompter is, probably, as important a gentleman as we
could first run against. The prompter stands at his
desk at one side of the stage, with a book of the play
before him during the entire performance. It is his
business to furnish the players with their lines when
memory fails them. He must be quick to give the
performer the exact word that has thrown him off the
track, and just as soon as an actor or actress looks appealingly
towards him he knows what it means&mdash;that
the performer is "stuck"&mdash;and he must run to their
aid at once. His position is almost as responsible as
that of the prompter in the Japanese theatre, who
goes from one actor to the other, during the whole
performance, and, with a lantern placed up against the
play-book, reads off the lines which the actor is expected
to repeat. He must be at the theatre during
the morning rehearsals; and he also writes out parts;
changes of scenes; makes lists of the properties or
articles needed; and altogether, his position is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
like a sinecure. A rule of the theatre, that in many
places, has glided quietly out of existence, is to the
effect that nobody must lounge in the prompter's
corner. But they do. Many a fairy queen, with
shining raiment and powerful wand, loiters around to
catch a glimpse of the few lines she has to speak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
while darling little princes in the nicest of tights, or
pirates, or bandits, with symmetrical limbs fully displayed,
and the softest of hearts beating under their
corsets, get alongside of him, and because they have
had little parts to memorize, and have let them slip
lightly and swiftly beyond their recollection, tease the
prompter to help them regain the lost words.</p>

<p>A veteran prompter, who has evidently seen a great
deal of the world beyond the foot-lights, in giving his
reminiscences, said&mdash;"Some actors boast that they
never stick. No matter if they have totally forgotten
their lines, they 'say something,' as they phrase it, and
I have never seen the difference noted by the audience
yet. Once, while I was making the rounds of the
Pacific coast, twenty years or so ago, I went to see
a performance of 'Macbeth,' by the company of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
friend of mine in San Francisco. It was a tough company,
a band of regulation old-time barn stormers,
and the fellow who played <i>Macbeth</i> was so far gone in
the dreamy vacancy of whiskey that he 'gagged' his
part more than once in the first scene. Finally, in the
middle of his second, he was also dead lost. He hesitated,
but only for a moment. Then he threw his
arms around <i>Lady Macbeth's</i> waist, and drawing her
to him, coolly said: 'Let us retire, dearest chuck,
and con this matter over in a more sequestered spot,
far from the busy haunts of men. Here the walls and
doors are spies, and our every word is echoed far and
near. Come, then, let's away! False heart must
hide, you know, what false heart dare not show.'
They made their exit in a roar of applause, and I
thought, 'There's a man who has no use for a
prompter, sure enough.'</p>

<p>"All actors are not like him, however. Raw actors
are the prompter's horror. The debutante is another.
She will forget every line the moment she strikes the
stage, and be so nervous, moreover, that she will not
be able to repeat those the prompter reads to her. I
remember one young lady who thought she had a mission
to play <i>Juliet</i>. She made her appearance, supported
by a country company, and lost every line, as
usual. We prompted her through her first scene, somehow.
When the balcony scene was on, her mother stood
on the ladder behind her, reading her speeches word for
word, which she repeated after her. But the old lady
was a heavy weight, and the step-ladder was no longer
in the flower of youth; so, in the middle of the farewell,
it gave way. The old lady was tumbled forward
against the ricketty staging of the balcony, and it fell
against the set piece that masked it in from the audience.
So <i>Juliet</i>, mother, balcony, and all toppled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>down on <i>Romeo</i>, and by the time he was taken from
the wreck he was as mournful a lover as the play makes
him out to be."</p>

fairy leaning up against some object with her lithe
limbs crossed, and she putting in the spare time allowed

she is knitting a purse for some distant lover, or maybe
it is a tiny pair of socks for the little baby that is waiting

<p>The story is told of a New York fireman, who made
real love, and too much of it, on the stage. According
to the rules of the fire department there, a member
of the department is kept on duty at every performance
in the theatres. While there he has nothing
to do except respond to any call of fire, and give his
valuable services in suppressing it. But it is very
seldom that his services are called into requisition, and
consequently the position at the theatre is much sought
after by the gallant fire laddies. As a rule, the members
of the department are a fine body of men, but those
detailed at the theatres are very fine-looking and consequently
very popular with the actresses at the theatres.
The natural result is that the fireman soon has
a "mash," and having unrestricted liberties perambulates
through the building without hindrance. Becoming
well acquainted with the nooks and corners he is enabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
to snatch a few moments' sweet converse with the
object of his affections, and in a place where they can
commune with one another uninfluenced by the presence
of anyone. But recently the regular disappearance of
the fireman of a certain theatre at a stated time became
the subject of comment among the attaches, and another
female admirer of the gallant fireman, actuated
possibly by jealous motives, watched him receding
from view and followed his footsteps silently. In an
unfrequented nook among the ruins of ancient mountains,
pillars and broad fields&mdash;on canvas&mdash;stood the
object of her disappointed affections, embracing the
fair form of her rival and giving vent to the pent-up
feelings of his heart, while she, coy, and dove-like,
stood, blushingly receiving the compliments which
were being showered upon her. This was too much
for the slighted fair one, and the place that knew the
loving hearts for many evenings is now vacant and
ready for the occupancy of another loving couple.</p>

<p>Another fire lad of the same department thought he
smelt fire one night just before the performance began.
He pried around through every nook and corner in the
fulfilment of his duty, and at last was satisfied that he
had found the place. He was not sufficiently well
posted to know that he had located the incipient blaze
in one of the ladies' dressing-rooms. So in he popped
without giving any warning. The girls were dressing
for the ballet and already one of them was in condition
to get into her symmetricals. Imagine the consternation
of the girls at sight of the apparition in blue
clothes, cap, and brass buttons. They hastily got
behind towels and other articles within reach and set
up a screech that came near creating a panic among the
audience. The fire boy did not wait to find the origin
of the smoke, and it took all the persuasive powers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
the manager and company to keep the girls from swearing
out warrants for burglary or something of that kind
against the luckless laddie.</p>

<p>There are a great many other ludicrous things that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
have happened behind the scenes, and but few of
which have reached the public. The legend about
Atkins Lawrence's lion skin, which he wears when he
plays <i>Ingomar</i>, and which was so heavily sprinkled
with snuff as a preservative against moths that when
<i>Parthenia</i> began to woo the barbarian chief and leant
lovingly upon his shoulder she almost sneezed her
head off before the alarmed audience, is told of Mary
Anderson. The Milwaukee <i>Sun</i> printed something
about the same actress, that whether true or false is
equally good. The writer says:&mdash;"It is well known
that Miss Anderson is addicted to the gum-chewing
habit, and that when she goes upon the stage she
sticks her chew of gum on an old castle painted on the
scenery. There was a wicked young man playing a
minor part in the play who had been treated scornfully
by Mary, as he thought, and he had been heard to say
he would make her sick. He did. He took her chew
of gum and spread it out so it was as thin as paper,
then placed a chew of tobacco inside, neatly wrapped
it up, and stuck it back on the old castle. Mary came
off, when the curtain went down, and going up to the
castle she bit like a bass. Putting the gum, which she
had no idea was loaded, into her mouth, she mashed it
between her ivories and rolled it as a sweet morsel
under her tongue. It is said by those who happened
to be behind the scenes, that when the tobacco began
to get in its work there was the worst transformation
scene that ever appeared on the stage. The air, one
supe said, seemed to be full of fine cut tobacco and
spruce gum, and Mary stood there and leaned against
a painted rock, a picture of homesickness. She was
pale about the gills, and trembled like an aspen leaf
shaken by the wind. She was calm as a summer's
morning, and while concealment like a worm in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
an apple, gnawed at her stomach, and tore her corset
strings, she did not upbraid the wretch who had
smuggled the vile pill into her countenance. All she
said, as she turned her pale face to the painted ivy on
the rock, and grasped a painted mantel piece with her
left hand, as her right hand rested on her heaving
stomach, was, 'I die by the hand of an assassin.'
Women can't be too careful where they put their
gum."</p>

<p>Actors are not fonder of or indulge more in liquor
than any other class. Occasionally you will find a
member of the profession whose passion for the ardent
will lead him far enough to disappoint the public.
Joe Emmet's indiscretions in this direction gave him
world-wide notoriety, and for this reason only do I
mention them here. He is a favorite everywhere and
for that reason the entire public regretted his one fault
among so many agreeable virtues. But Joe has occasioned
many comical situations in the side scenes while
actors and manager were plying him with seltzer,
bromide of potassium and other soberatives in order
to get him to begin or finish a play, when there was a
jammed house waiting to applaud him at every turn in
"Fritz." But Emmet has crossed the Rubicon again
and once more his worldful of friends rejoice in his
happiness and growing fortune. He is not the only
one in the profession who has been addicted to the cup
that cheers and inebriates at the same time. I have
heard that a pretty and popular soubrette must have
her glass of brandy between the acts, and that an actor
already at the top of the ladder is succumbing to the
seductive and rosy liquid. Still liquor has not made
nearly the number of victims in the ranks of the
theatrical class that it has in other professions, and it
is only alluded to here to illustrate a comical incident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
that once occurred during the engagement of a burlesque
combination in Kansas City. It was not known
until six o'clock at night that the comedian of the
comedy was in a sad state of intoxication somewhere
through the town. Parties were sent out at once
to look him up. They did not succeed in finding him
until 7:30 when they hurried him to the theatre. It
was a terrible job to get him into his stage-clothes and
to keep his head steady and his eyes open long enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
to allow his friends to make him up for his part. By
the time this had been done the impatient audience
shouted and whistled and stamped so violently that at
last the manager was obliged to ring the curtain up.
Mr. Comedian was in the wings reluctantly accepting
the remedies provided by his friends, while they waited
for his cue to go on. He was fairly sober when he
reached the presence of the audience and although he
betrayed his condition slightly, few in the house
knew enough about the trouble that had been taken
with him in order that the manager might keep his
word with the public. It is needless to add that Mr.
Comedian was very sorry, and sick when he got sober.</p>

<p>The night the Southern Hotel burned down in St.
Louis, I was standing at the ladies' entrance when Kate
Claxton, whose presence is now always regarded in a
city as ominous of a conflagration, came down through
the fire and smoke in her night dress and was hurried
across the street and out of danger by a gentleman who
lent her his overcoat while she made her way to
another hotel. There were seventeen lives lost that
terrible night, and a young and beautiful actress&mdash;Frankie
McLellan&mdash;in a frantic effort to escape the
flames, jumped from a three story window and had her
face marked for life by the fall. Just as soon as people
got over the horror of the first news of the catastrophe,
gossip turned to theorizing and from that
diversant stories were told concerning the prominent
people who figured in the calamity. Then it became
known that Milton Nobles had lost a brand new pair of
lavender trousers, in the pockets of which were several
hundred dollars that "The Phœnix" had brought
him that same evening. Then too, the narrow escape
of Rose Osborne, of the Olympic stock company, was
recited; but prominent above all, Miss Kate Claxton's
presence in the hotel was dwelt upon, and, as she had
already fairly earned the unanimous reputation that has
since followed her, her name became part of the history
of the conflagration, as it has been associated with
every conflagration that occurred in her vicinage since.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
She is rather ungallantly and untruly styled the "Fire
Fiend," and all sorts of predictions are made about
the theatre she plays in, the hotel she has her rooms at,
and the very town and county in which she is temporarily
domiciled. But Kate Claxton, who by the way
is Mrs. Stevenson, is not the first person in her profession
to have acquired such an unenviable reputation.
Thomas S. Hamblin, an actor and manager of the early
half of the present century, who came from England in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
1825 to star in "Shakespeare," was followed by fire even
more relentlessly than Miss Claxton has been. No less
than four theatres burned under his management, and
it was generally said when he undertook to open or
run a place of amusement that from that moment it
was fated to the flames. Hamblin figures conspicuously
in the history of the Bowery. He died in 1854.</p>

<p>The sailor who braves the dangers of the deep is always
blindly superstitious. There is something in the
vastness of the ocean, in its misty immensity, in its
magic mirage, its wonders and its terrors, that puzzles
the mind and sets fire to the imagination of poor Jack,
and even bewilders his superior officers. The artist
who undertakes to sail before the public and to amuse
it for a living is quite as much at sea as your genuine
Jack Tar. He or she finds himself or herself on a
veritable ocean, beset by dangers, surrounded by unknown
and fickle conditions of atmosphere and phenomena.
All the logic of the dry land is of no avail
in such a situation. The relations of cause and effect
are broken up. Magic is the only excuse for the arrival
of the unexpected. The seemingly impossible in
results is always the most possible. Once embarked
in the dramatic sea, no one can tell where the voyage
may end, or what it may bring forth. A shipwreck
on auriferous rocks may prove a success.</p>

<p>Triumph may come from ruin; happiness from danger,
and the longest voyage and the richest freight are
often given the most leaky and shallow craft. There
is no knowing which boat will float the longest on the
dramatic sea&mdash;the best equipped or the most shaky
and flimsy. So it is no wonder that actors are all
superstitious. They have no compass even to guide
them when beset by the varying winds of public opinion.
The impossible is always sure to meet them; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
they are always on the lookout for magic, and depend
in secret quite as much upon their simple necromancy
as upon their talent or their study. Every star has,
so to speak, a fetich that insures success, or goes
through an imaginary formula to invoke prosperity.
The public is constantly under the influence of the
voudoo arts of actors, and incantations and mystic
signs rule the world of Thespis and enslave the public
without its knowledge. Some of these fancies and
formulæ of intelligent actors are, indeed, more simple
and childlike than those that characterize poor Jack of
the briny deep.</p>

<p>Imagine, for instance, an actor like John McCullough
refusing to approach a theatre except by one
route (the one he first takes, no matter how roundabout)
from night to night, for fear of breaking the
charm of success. Imagine, too, a lot of other trifling
things that beset him&mdash;signs, omens and the like.
If he stumbles when he first enters a scene it is a sign
of good luck. If he receives faint applause in the first
scene he is sure to succeed, amid thunderous plaudits,
in the last; if Forrest's sword, used in the Gladiator,
becomes dim by damp air or other cause, it is a sign
of lack of fervor in the audience of the evening, while,
on the contrary an extraordinary brightness of the
weapon is a sure sign of great success. If a negro
should cross his path while he is on his way to a performance,
that is a never-failing omen of a prosperous
engagement, while to encounter a cross-eyed woman
(not a man, for strabismus in that sort of creature
does not affect John, probably because it is only the
woman he looks at), is a sure sign if not of failure,
at least of annoyance to himself and coldness on the
part of his audience. The Macbeth music is, of
course, his great bugbear, as it is with all actors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_39" class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">

  <div class="caption">THE LATE VENIE CLANCIE.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
No success could attend any of his performances if
any one were to hum or whistle the witches' chorus in
the wings or the dressing-rooms. Any poor, inexperienced
devil who might try it would find John, and,
in fact, all the company, wrestling with him, and himself
lying in the gutter at the back door before he had
warbled through two bars of the fatal music. This is,
in the opinion of every actor, a sure invocation of disaster.
Under the malign influence of this melodic
devilishness either the theatre will be burned down
(for, if we are to believe the actors and stage tradition,
every theatre that was ever burned in this country
was put under the spell of fire by some singer or
whistler of the witches' chorus), or salaries will not be
paid, or the manager will bring his season to an early
and disastrous end. Something ill is sure to happen
if the Macbeth music is heard, and John shares that
belief in common with even the humblest Roman of
them all who parades his scraggy shanks nightly in
ridiculous contrast with the heroic legs of the tragedian.</p>

<p>John T. Raymond, while believing faithfully in all
the regular signs and omens of the stage, has his own
special claims to "hog 'em," using the stage vernacular.
He has only one suit of clothes for <i>Colonel
Sellers</i>, and would not have any other under any circumstances.
It would change his luck from good to
bad.</p>

<p>"Remark," he says, "there never was a success
continued where a play was entirely re-costumed.
The public interest began to flag always in some mysterious
way from the time the new dresses came on.
It is the old story of old wine in new bottles. The
wine will burst the bottles. There's going to be no
burst with my wine. I stick to my old clothes as long
as they will stick to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

  <div class="caption">CATHERINE LEWIS.</div></div>

<p>He has also a lucky $5 gold piece, which he always
carries in his vest pocket on the stage, whatever part
he is playing, and when he is nervous and fearful of
lack of appreciation he has only to rub his magic coin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
to make everything lovely. In getting out of bed he
will not slip out with the left foot first, lest he may
have bad luck all the day. His dreams decide his acceptance
of a play, and when he is puzzled between
two methods of working up a "point," he is perfectly
satisfied to settle it by the toss up of a cent.</p>

<p>Joe Jefferson is also impressed with the magical
potency of old clothes. He has never changed his
first "Rip Van Winkle" suit, but he has been forced
to have it patched and renovated. His hat, wig, beard
and "trick" rifle&mdash;the one that falls to pieces after
his long sleep&mdash;are the same that he used when he made
his great success in the part in London fifteen years
ago. He mislaid this gun last season, just before he
played at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, and was forced to
get another. That engagement was his first failure,
and a bad one. He has found the old rifle, and, the
charm being now complete again, he has opened the
season with a very successful week in Brooklyn. Joe
would break an engagement in any theatre if a dog
were to walk across the stage at the first rehearsal.
That is a sure sign of death, loss, or fire, as every
actor knows. A cat parading the coulisses or walking
with dainty tread across the scene, however (even at
an evening performance), would be hailed by him and
colleagues with delight as an unfailing sign of prosperity,
health and renown.</p>

<p>Sothern felt that he was sure to fail with his audience
if his valet, by an accident, handed him his wig
before his coat was on, while, if he put it on his head
at the last moment, and not before the voices of the
call-boy was heard summoning all on for his first scene,
he had "got 'em dead to rights."</p>

<p>Florence, like Raymond, carries a lucky $5 gold
piece, and believes the charm of his popularity reposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
in the fact that he always puts on his costumes in a
never-varying order, and never changes his old brushes
and articles of "make-up." He, too, is afraid of the
necromantic powers of the evil-omened dog, and believes
in the magic spells of fairy grimalkin. If the
orchestra plays a waltz between the first and second
acts of his piece, success is more likely than ever to seal
his efforts of the evening.</p>

<p>Mrs. Florence, on the contrary, does not believe in
old clothes, but quite the reverse. She thinks, however,
that birds (canaries, or any other variety) are sure
to bring bad luck, and will not play in the company
where there is a cross-eyed girl. The cross-eyed man
doesn't count. If the prompter should tear a page of
manuscript accidentally, or, moreover, if the page
should contain the name or a speech of the character
she is acting, there is no use in hoping for a great
furor that evening, for there will be nothing but disappointments
in the making of points and contretemps
in the management of the stage. If the prompter
turns out the foot-lights or a row of border-lights,
swift disaster is sure to come on the theatre. This
was never known to fail in her experience.</p>

<p>Booth will never go on the stage, no matter how
late or hurried he may be, without first pacing three
time across the green-room, mumbling over not the
first, but the very last speech of the piece he is to play
that night. Then he walks on, sure of his triumph.
If he should fail in his formula, the audience would be
cold and unappreciative. It has been his custom to
have <i>Desdemona's</i> couch set in the second entrance on
the stage, left in the last scene of "Othello." According
to the old style, the couch should be set in the
centre door, behind curtains, exactly in front of the
audience. Booth believes in signs, however, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
should he consent to have <i>Desdemona</i> slumber in any
other place than U.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;L. he would lose his charm in
the character of <i>Iago</i>.</p>

  <div class="caption">CHANFRAU.</div></div>

<p>Frank Chanfrau believes in the efficacy of old
clothes. He has only one suit in <i>Kit</i>, and his success
is unvarying in that piece. He hates dogs on the
stage, believes in cats, knows birds are bad luck, is
convinced that a house decorated in a prevailing hue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
of decided blue is sure of ill-fortune, and shudders at
the mere mention of the Macbeth music. He has
steered clear of all these evil influences during his
stage career, and has been uniformly successful.</p>

<p>Oliver Doud Byron has a special claim in addition
to the regular superstitions of his class. He has a
certain tattoo mark of India ink on his right forearm.
When he rolls up his sleeves for his "terrible combat"
in the last act of "Across the Continent," he
must uncover that mark without looking at it, or his
fetich is not complete, and the charm of his prosperity
will be broken.</p>

<p>Charles Thorne believes his success lies in the fact
that he always steps on the stage in the first scene
with his right foot foremost, and keeps it in advance
until he has delivered his first speech. This done, he
is safe and sure of a "walk over" before his critics.
Once or twice he has inadvertently stepped out with
his left, and on these occasions he has failed, or the
piece has fallen flat. Such an accident happened him
on the first night of "Lost Children." Manager Palmer,
of the Union Square, who has also become a victim
of stage superstitions, is fearful of Thorne stepping
out with his terrible left foot on a first night, just out
of retaliation for some slight or disagreement. Thorne,
possessing this magic power for good or evil, not at
his fingers' ends, but at the ends of his toes, is a terror
to the establishment, and on first nights is treated
with distinguished consideration by the entire company.
No one gets in his way when he is about to
make his stage entrance on a first night, lest he may
be thrown out of step and advance with sinister effect
upon the scene. Thorne's right foot once put forward,
every one breathes freer and plays with greater vim.
The critical point of every new play, therefore, lies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
though the critics may not think it, in the malign or
favorable magic of Thorne's feet, according as he puts
them forward.</p>

<p>Adelaide Neilson was as superstitious as all actresses
are. Her evenly-balanced beauty and brains did not
free her from the slavery of omens. She carried about
with her, ever since her first London success in <i>Juliet</i>,
a lucky silken rag&mdash;a dingy, straw-colored drapery&mdash;which
she insisted upon hanging over the railing of
the balcony when <i>Juliet</i> breathes her complaints to
the moon. Without this, the fair Adelaide was sure
she could not succeed in the scene in any part of the
world. She brought the silken rag across the water
with her again and again. The drapery was somewhat
faded and tattered from long service in the two worlds,
but she still clung fondly to it, and said it was possessed
of all its olden magic.</p>

<p>Lotta sleeps three hours by daylight, but if she
should wake up ten minutes before the usual time (just
the time to rush to the theatre) the fates are against
her, and she will not do well that evening. If any one
whistles in a dressing-room within her hearing while
she is donning her costume, she is sure the person is
"whistling away her luck," and the house is going to
be bad.</p>

<p>Fanny Davenport would not, for any consideration,
miss rearranging her wig before the green-room mirror
just previous to going on the stage. She has a regular,
unvarying formula to go through to guarantee success.
She first presses her hands to the sides of her head to
be sure the springs are firmly fixed (although she has
just had her dresser make that sure in her dressing-room),
then gives the "bang" three smart tugs, puffs
up the frizzes with a nervous twitch of her fingers,
presses the entire wig down from the top of her head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
gives her silken trail a final kick to induce it to unfold
itself, and then rushes pell mell to the stage in answer
to the alarming cry of "stage waiting." Without this
formality she would not be herself the whole evening.</p>

<p>Clara Morris believes in the efficacy of a small medicine
vial, which she carries (empty) through every
scene, she says, through habit, though it is fair to
presume, through superstition. Without the vial she
could not get along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Neilson also had a vial&mdash;a special one&mdash;which she
insisted should only be used for <i>Romeo's</i> poison potion.
She would handle no other, and has been known
to have the bill changed because the vial was mislaid,
and would not allow "Romeo and Juliet" to be put
up for performance until it was found.</p>

<p>Frank Mayo thinks his magic lies in an old fur cap
and a hare's foot,
for rouging, which
he had ever since

luck, before going
on the stage. This,
too, to the intense
horror of the rest
of the company,
who think dogs in
theatres bad luck.</p>

<p>Sara Jewett imagines
that she commands
success and
enslaves her audiences
by walking
through her positions
on the stage
in her first scene
every night before the curtain is rung up for the play.</p>

<p>The managers, too, share this weakness of their
actors. None of them would change their ticket-boxes
for fear of a change of luck. When they move
they take their ticket-boxes with them. Wallack has
the same boxes that were used at the doors of his
father's theatre years ago, and Daly has those which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
received the pasteboards during his first season of success.
When Tony Pastor removed from the Bowery
to Broadway he took his boxes over there, and has
them with him now in his tour over the country.
With all our modern innovations and realism, we have
not made any inroads on the folk-lore of the drama.
The theatre is still fairy-land, and its creatures, though
not fairies themselves, commune with them closely.</p>

<p>Actors like many other people have a perfect horror
of the number thirteen. The only man in the profession
who openly defies the superstition attaching to
this number is John R. Rogers, the manager of the
"My Sweetheart" Company, of which Minnie Palmer
and Robert E. Graham are the star features. Rogers, it
is said, not only got together a company of thirteen people,
in which the thirteen letters of Mr. Graham's name
stood out in uninviting prominence; but he began his
season on Friday, the 13th of the month, and in other
ways wooed a dire and speedy fate for himself and his
people; but good luck appears to have attended him,
and he is still defiant as ever of the terror-laden and
ominous number. In contradistinction to Mr. Roger's
success, the failure of another combination may be
given. Frank L. Gardner, who has thirteen letters in
his name, brought out the play "Legion of Honor,"
whose title is composed of exactly thirteen letters, and
had Samuel W. Piercy,&mdash;who died last winter in
Boston, while supporting Edwin Booth in his tour,&mdash;for
leading man, and by doing so freighted down his
enterprise with another ill-starred feature, for Mr.
Piercy's name contained thirteen letters. The play
failed, and the superstitious people of the profession
immediately attributed the failure to the presence of
too many baker's dozens in the organization. A certain
well-known prima donna whose engagement was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
to begin on the 13th of the month went to the impresario
and begged to have the date changed; she
said she knew she would have no luck if she began to
sing on the date provided for her; besides that her
friends had persuaded her that fortune would only
frown upon her if she made her first appearance on the
13th. The 12th was Friday, another day fraught
with frightful evil to the singing and acting fraternity,
so rather than make an unlucky beginning, the prima
donna opened on the 11th, and sang two nights for
nothing, although two nights' warbling under her contract
meant an amount of money that would make a
poor man's head swim.</p>

<p>The New York <i>Dramatic News</i> in a late number
contained a funny story about Harry Courtaine and
John E. Ince, both gentlemen well and favorably
known in the profession. Mr. Ince had solemnly professed
his non-belief in good or bad luck, after which
he was invited by Mr. Courtaine to walk with him.
The <i>News</i> tells the story in this happy style: To a
query as to where he was going, Mr. Courtaine replied
that he was to make an engagement for the coming
season with a gentleman now awaiting him at the
Union Square Hotel, "and I want a witness," he said,
"but I wouldn't have one of those superstitious fellows
with me for all the world. They make me
ashamed of myself with their besotted&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Courtaine stopped suddenly and turned deadly
pale. "Here, here!" he cried, "cross fingers,
quick!" and seizing Mr. Ince's hand, he crossed the
forefinger of his own over it while a tramp with one
arm slouched by them. "I saw him over my left
shoulder, too," murmured Mr. Courtaine. "Dear
me! dear me! how exceedingly annoying!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Mr. Ince, whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
performance of his companion had thrown into a profound
amazement. "Don't you feel well? What
is it?"</p>

<div id="ip_45" class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
  <img src="images/i_139.jpg" width="325" height="372" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">MAUD GRANGER.</div></div>

<p>"Nothing," replied Mr. Courtaine, in some confusion.
"A slight twinge of my old gout. Those fellows
on the square are enough to give a man the colic,
with their eternal talk about Jonahs, unlucky houses,
hoodoo managers and the like. I don't know anything
I detest more than superstition," said Mr. Courtaine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
with indignant fervor. "I think it is a lower
and more debased vice than habitual drunkenness.
If there was a law passed to make it a capital offence,
I'm d&mdash;d if I wouldn't serve as hangman without asking
a cent pay."</p>

<p>At this juncture an old woman, enveloped in an
odorous combination of rags and liquor, seized Mr.
Courtaine by the sleeve and rolled two eyes, which
squinted across at each other almost at right-angles,
towards the sky, as she <span class="locked">whined:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Please, good gentleman, a penny to buy a poor
widow bread. Only a penny, dear, handsome gentleman,
and God go with you."</p>

<p>Mr. Courtaine dove into his pocket to respond to this
artful appeal, and as he did so, glanced at the old
woman. Then he began a performance which plunged
his companion in a stupor of wonder. Crossing his
forefingers, he deliberately spat upon the pavement
over them, and then turning in a circle, repeated the
expectoration at each of the four points of the compass.
This accomplished, he mopped the perspiration
from his pallid brow, and shuddered visibly. "It's
Friday, too," he muttered. "D&mdash;n it all! I might
have known it."</p>

<p>"Known what?" asked Mr. Ince.</p>

<p>"Let's go down to Theiss's and get a beer," said
Mr. Courtaine abruptly and irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"You'd better see your man first," suggested the
prudent Mr. Ince.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He can wait; besides I think it's too
late to catch him in now. I'll hunt him up to-morrow.
Come along."</p>

<p>The libation performed, Mr. Ince suggested that
they should drop in at the matinee at Pastor's. Mr.
Courtaine favored a stroll. Mr. Ince suggested that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
his programme would turn out the most pleasing one,
and Mr. Courtaine said: "Hold on; we can easily
see;" and producing a half-dollar he flipped it, asking,
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Heads," answered Mr. Ince.</p>

<p>"It's tail," remarked Mr. Courtaine. "So the
stroll will turn out best. Let's be moving."</p>

<p>They moved along, and as they passed a fruit stand
Mr. Ince remarked: "Hello! there are some strawberries."</p>

<p>"Ze first-a of ze season a-Signore," said the Neapolitan
nobleman, who presided over the destinies of the
stand, with a bow of invitation, "ze very first-a, only
feefty cent-a ze box-a."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" cried Mr. Courtaine, picking out three
of the finest and leaving the box a quarter empty,
"now, then, Ince, make a wish."</p>

<p>"What for?" demanded Mr. Ince, making a raid on
the box on his own account.</p>

<p>"Never mind," replied Mr. Courtaine, evasively,
"only whenever you eat new fruit or vegetables make
a wish."</p>

<p>And he posted the strawberries into his oratorical
orifice, and walked off, leaving the fruit vender foaming
at the mouth, and snarling "<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">corpo di diavola!</i>
zese actor 'ave-a ze sheek-a of a policeman. Oh!
<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Madonna mia!</i> Eef zem boys 'ad not steal-a my
club!"</p>

<p>The stroll was varied by no further incidents except
that Mr. Courtaine walked a block around to avoid
passing a drunken man, and nearly lost his life snatching
a cast horseshoe up from in front of a street-car.
As they turned homeward Mr. Courtaine's eyes singled
out a lady approaching with an armful of bundles, and
he commenced a species of maniac gavotte, waving his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
hands at her and shouting: "Go into the street.
Hey! Hey! look out for the ladder!"</p>

<p>And when in spite of his adjurations, Mrs. Courtaine&mdash;for
the lady was none other&mdash;walked under a
ladder leaning against the side of a rising building. He
sank upon a row of beer kegs and fastened a cumulative
grip on Mr. Ince's arm, exclaiming&mdash;"Did you
witness it wasn't my fault? I warned her in time,
didn't I?"</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"Do you remember my wife walking under a ladder
yesterday?" observed Mr. Courtaine to Mr. Ince on
the morrow.</p>

<p>"Yes, what of it?"</p>

<p>"Well, when we got home we found the cat had
killed the canary bird&mdash;killed and ate it all but the
tail feathers," said Mr. Courtaine triumphantly.
"Now what do you think of that? Here come around
to Theiss's or we'll have those fellows around us with
their infernal low-minded superstitions again."</p>

<p>Some very queer things happen behind the scenes,
and even on the stage in full view of the audience&mdash;occurrences
that often mar the pleasure of the play
for the people in the auditorium, and raise the wrath
of the performer. Anything out of the usual run
of business that occurs behind the scenes throws the
players off the track frequently. There is a great deal
of work going on at all times, out of sight or knowledge
of the audience, and a slight disturbance may be
an interruption fraught with dire disaster. There are
actors and actresses in the wings, often, completing the
memorization of their parts&mdash;"winging" parts, as it
is called&mdash;or it may be going over their lines again,
if they are not confident that they have full possession
of them; and to these people, of course, an interruption
is a matter of the merest moment. Actors
and actresses have always been credited with good
memories, but even the best memory may sometimes
be thrown off the track, and, indeed, sometimes is,
by an untoward or startling incident.</p>

<p>Speaking of memory, reminds me that an actor
once memorized an entire newspaper, when they were
smaller than now, in a single night. The actor was a
man named Lyon, who was playing small parts through
the country. An English actor committed the contents
of the London <i>Times</i>, advertisements and all, within
a week, besides studying a new part for every night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
The feat was accomplished on a wager. An actor in
London, sat through a play, and although he had
never seen it before, could repeat every line and word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
of it when he got home. He sat down and wrote it
out, and the copy thus written was used for the performance
of the play in New York. Many readers
will recollect the New York couple prosecuted by the
Madison Square Theatre Company for selling copies
of "Hazel Kirke" to companies that had no right
to play the drama. The wife, it was explained, went
to the theatre, sat the play out a few times, and dictated
the lines to her husband from memory. She
had been an actress. There are many other remarkable
instances of swift and retentive memories in the
profession, but one of the most astonishing of all
these feats is what is known as "winging a part," an
expression I have used before in this chapter. This
consists in going on the stage without having studied
the lines at all, the actor carrying the book in his
pocket, and pulling it out every time he gets out
of sight of the audience, studying the part in the
"wings" until he receives his cue to go on again.
This method of going through the part continues
during the performance, the actor speaking the lines
to the best of his ability, and following the text as
closely as possible.</p>

<p>Returning to the subject of the chapter, there are
several instances of actors and actresses, prominent and
minor, receiving their death strokes on the stage while
playing. Mistress Woffington, known as "lovely
Peggy," while playing at Covent Garden, London, May
3, 1757, fell to the stage at the end of the fourth act of
"As You Like it," in which she was playing <i>Rosalind</i>,
and after muttering "O God! O God!" was carried
home to die after a lingering confinement of three
years to her bed. George Frederick Cooke received
his death stroke in New York, while playing <i>Sir
Giles Overreach</i>, and Edmund Kean died in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
under similar circumstances. The elder Kean and his
son Charles were playing together, the former having
the role of <i>Othello</i>, the latter that of <i>Iago</i>. The date was
March 25, 1833. The event, says a chronicler, created
great excitement among play-goers; the house was
crammed. Kean, who had worn himself out with dissipation,
went through the part, "dying as he went,"
until he came to the "Farewell," and the strangely
appropriate words, "Othello's occupation's gone."
Then he gasped for breath and fell upon his son's
shoulder, moaning, "I am dying&mdash;speak to them for
me!" And so the curtain descended upon him&mdash;forever.
His wife had separated from him. "Come
home to me; forget and forgive!" he wrote her after
he had been conveyed to Richmond. And she came.
An hour before he died he sprang out of bed, exclaiming,
"A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!"
and he expired with the dying words of Octavian,
"Farewell, Flo&mdash;&mdash; Floranthe!" upon his lips. This
was on May 15, 1833, and he was buried in Richmond
churchyard. Instances of the same appalling
kind might be multiplied, but it is not the purpose of
the writer to cover the stage with gloom, or to cause
death to masquerade any more than is absolutely necessary
before the foot-lights. More interest will be
felt, and the heart will be lighter and the appetite
better, if we turn to the ludicrous incidents that have
caused audiences ready to shed tears over a tragedy, to
turn from the lachrymose attitude to one which might
be represented as laughter holding both his sides.</p>

<p>Sol Smith tells a funny story about his earliest experiences
on the stage; how he stole in through the
back door before the performance, and hid in what he
thought was a chest, but which turned out to be the
coffin used in the play that evening, and when it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>carried out on the stage young Smith was so terrified
that he pushed up the lid and bounded out, to the surprise
of both actors and audience. N.&nbsp;M. Ludlow,
who was Smith's partner in the theatrical business, relates
a somewhat similar incident about himself.</p>

<p>The awkward position of a "masher" who gets into
the "wings" by some hook or crook is often extremely
laughable. I saw a serio-comic vocalist&mdash;as the
songstresses of the variety stage are named&mdash;astonish
a well-dressed and admiring gentleman who was lounging
around at his leisure,&mdash;having in some mysterious
manner passed the stage door-keeper,&mdash;by handing
him a pin and remarking, "Pin up my skirts." The
man's eye-glass was knocked out of place by the impertinence
of the demand, but he took the pin and
obeyed the lady's command, and this, too, notwithstanding
a second female in tights, was near by, who
could have done the job a thousand times better. It
was the sweet singer's little joke, though.</p>

<p>Charlotte Cushman and her sister were playing in
Trenton, New Jersey, one night. The bill announced
was "Romeo and Juliet," with Miss Cushman in her
afterwards famous impersonation of the male character
and her sister as <i>Juliet</i>. The ball-room of the town
which was used as a theatre, when occasion required,
was sadly lacking in scenery and properties. The sisters
went to work, however, and succeeded in getting
together everything they needed for the performance,
except the balcony in the garden scene. After looking
around they found an old bed-quilt, patched, and
abounding in numerous colors; it was arranged that a
colored bell-boy from an adjacent hotel should, while
stationed in the side-scenes, out of view, hold up one
end of the quilt while the fair <i>Juliet</i> supported the
other. The boy was on hand in the evening, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
everything went swimmingly until towards the end of
the scene, and in a most tender part, the darkey stuck
his head out from the side and said: "I say, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Cushing, I hear my bell ringin' an' Ize obliged to let
my side ob de house drap!" He dropped the quilt;
and not only the balcony, but "the house"&mdash;the
audience&mdash;came down, and that brought the scene to
an abrupt and ridiculous end.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE CALL-BOY'S REVENGE.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Another occasion that was a source of infinite amusement
to an audience that had been fully worked up to
tragic interest in the play of "Hamlet," occurred at
Baltimore, Maryland, a short time ago. The actor
cast for <i>King Claudius</i> had given some offence to the
call-boy&mdash;treated him badly in the presence of the
company&mdash;so the boy made up his mind to have ample
revenge. He got a needle, fitted a long piece of
thread in it, and then placed it in the cushion chair
that answered for the <i>King's</i> throne, in such a way
that when the time arrived, by a simple jerk of the
string he might move the needle skyward. He waited
until <i>Claudius</i> was supposed to be most interested in
the scene before the players, when jerk went the thread,
and <i>King Claudius</i>, with an alacrity unbecoming royalty,
bounded out of his chair as quickly as if he had
suddenly sat down upon the sharp end of a lightning
rod. He dropped his sceptre and shouting "Ouch!"
and nursing the injured part of his anatomy, jumped
and danced around as if he had just caught sight of
<i>Hamlet's</i> father's ghost. There was an interruption
to the scene that the audience filled in with boisterous
laughter. After the act the <i>King</i>, instead of sending
one of his officers or guards for the call-boy, as befitted
his exalted station, went scouring around the
scenery himself, muttering the wildest threats and applying
names to that poor boy that he could hardly
have won for himself if he lived to be a thousand years
old. It is hardly necessary to say that the call-boy did
not wait around until the end of that act.</p>

<p>Mrs. Farrel, who was an actress of ability in her
time, after being hissed in the part of <i>Zaira</i>, the
heroine of "The Mourning Bride," and particularly in
the dying scene, rose from the stage, and, approaching
the foot-lights, expressed her regret at not having merited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
the applause of the audience, and explained that
she had only accepted the part to oblige a friend, and
hoped she would be excused for not playing it better.
After this little speech she once more assumed a recumbent
position, and was covered by the attendants
with a black veil.</p>

<p>On one occasion a danseuse was listening to the protestations
of an elderly lover, who was on the point of
kissing her hand, when, as he stooped down his wig
caught in the spangles of her dress. At that moment
she was called to the stage, and made her appearance before
the audience amid general laughter and applause;
for on the front of her dress was the old beau's wig
or scalp, hanging like a trophy from her belt. The
applause was renewed when a bald head was seen projecting
from the wing in search of its artificial covering.
Stories, too, are told of imprudent admirers,
who, having excited the jealousy of the stage carpenter,
did not take the precaution to avoid traps, and as a
consequence found themselves shot up into the "flies,"
or hastily dropped down to the dismal depths below
the stage.</p>

<p>It is a very common trick to let people through a
trap-door. I was present several times in the theatre
when victims were carried down to the black and uninviting
space below the stage. At a benefit given to
a popular treasurer in St. Louis, a well-known young
man who was in the liquor business was prevailed upon
to appear in the programme and was put down for a
lecture on temperance. The house was crowded that
night, and P&mdash;&mdash; H&mdash;&mdash; was there in all the glory
and wealth of his wardrobe, fully prepared to entertain
the audience for half an hour or so. One of the boys
had had the pleasure&mdash;so he termed it&mdash;of hearing
H&mdash;&mdash; read his lecture through, and he gave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
others the cue for the fun. The lecturer's table was
placed just at the edge of a trap, and a trick candle,
one such as is used in pantomime, and that keeps on
growing taller and taller as the clown in vain tries to
get within reach of the flame, stood at one side of the
piece of furniture. H&mdash;&mdash; went on the stage bowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
his neatest and smiling his sweetest. He was, of
course, received with "thunders of applause," and
storms of the same kind interrupted him at frequent
intervals. At last the place was reached where the
fun was to commence. "Bang!" went a gun in the
air, the thunder rolled, there was red fire, and the
floor parted. Down went H&mdash;&mdash; slowly, and up went
the candle. He was so terror-stricken that he could
do nothing, and was left to grope his way through the
darkness to the stairs. The language he used when
he once more found himself among his friends was
stronger and less elegant than were the phrases of his
lecture. He appears at no more benefits.</p>

<p>A young society man now of Cincinnati was treated
in the same way, a trap having been left open upon
which he stepped in the middle of a play in which he
took the leading part with a company of amateurs,
when down he went, to the dismay of his friends, the
delight of the young fellows who had "put up the
job," and to his own horror. In Leadville, Col., a
serio-comic singer who had incurred the displeasure of
one of the stage hands, was retiring into the side
scenes bowing gracefully and kissing her hand to the
audience, when suddenly down went one of her pink-clad
limbs through an open trap, and her moment of
triumph was turned into one of ridicule, and in addition
to her mortification the leg was broken. Such
tricks are always dangerous and more frequently are
followed by mourning than fun.</p>

<p>Powell, the English actor, sought in vain one night
for a "super" who was wont to dress him, but who
on this occasion had undertaken to play the part of
<i>Lothario's</i> corpse in "The Fair Penitent." Powell,
who took the principal character, shouted in an angry
tone for Warren, who could not help raising his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
from out the coffin in which he was lying, and answering,
"Here, sir." "Come, then," continued
Powell, not knowing where the voice came from, "or
I'll break every bone in your body!" Warren, knowing
that his master was quite capable of carrying out
the threat, sprang in his fright out of the coffin and
ran in his winding-sheet across the stage.</p>

<p>The dying heroes and heroines of the present day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
wait to regain animation until the curtain has fallen,
when they reappear in their own private characters at
the foot-lights. A distinguished tenor, Signor Giuglini,
being much applauded one night for his singing in
the "Miserere" scene of "Il Trovatore," quitted the
dungeons in which <i>Manrico</i> is supposed to be confined,
came forward to the public, bowed, and then, not to
cheat the executioner, went quietly back to prison
again. A much more modern story of the confusion
of facts with appearances is told, and with truth, of a
distinguished military amateur, who had undertaken,
for one occasion only, to play the part of <i>Don Giovanni</i>.
In the scene in which the profligate hero is
seized and carried down to the infernal regions, the
principal character could neither persuade nor compel
the demons, who were represented by private soldiers,
to lay hands on one whom, whatever part he might
temporarily assume, they knew well to be a colonel in
the army. The demons kept at a respectful distance,
and, when ordered in a loud whisper to lay hands on
their dramatic victim, contented themselves with falling
into an attitude of attention.</p>

<p>Jules Janin, in the collection of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">feuilletons</i> published
under the title of "Histoire de la Littérature
Dramatique," tells how in the ultra-tragic tragedy of
"Tragadalbas," an actor, in the midst of a solemn
tirade, let a set of false teeth fall from his mouth.
This was nothing more or less than an accident which
might happen to any one. Lord Brougham is said to
have suffered the same misfortune while speaking in
the House of Lords. But the great tragedian showed
great presence of mind, and also a certain indifference
to the serious nature of the work in which he was engaged,
when he coolly stooped down, picked up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
teeth, replaced them between his jaws, and continued
his speech.</p>

that of a blind man, the actor to whom this part had
been assigned was unwell, and it seemed necessary to
call upon another member of the company to read the
part. Thus the strange spectacle was witnessed of a
man supposed to be totally blind, who read every word

<span class="subhead">THE ILLUSIONS OF THE STAGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A person can gain an idea of the extent of stage
decorations and the possibility of scenic illusions in the
old English theatre by reading a description of the
theatre as it existed in its poverty of costume and
bareness of paint in the Elizabethan era. Rousseau
has left a description of the Paris Opera House as he
saw it and it will be found interesting to all who are
acquainted with the methods and the absolute magnitude
of the theatre of the present day. It must be
remembered, however, when considering the smallness
of the stage described by Rousseau, that it was blocked
up on both sides, as was the early English stage, by
the aristocratic section of the audience, who sat in rows
by the side of the singers while the plebeian music
lovers stood up in the pit. It was in exactly the same
condition as the English stage, when actors and actresses
were interrupted and even insulted by their
lordly patrons;&mdash;as when Mrs. Bellamy one evening
as she passed across the stage at Dublin was kissed
upon the neck by a Mr. St. Leger, whose ears the
actress boxed there and then; Lord Chesterfield rose
in his box on this occasion and applauded; the entire
audience followed his example and at the end of the
performance St. Leger was obliged by the viceroy to
make a public apology to the actress.</p>

<p>"Imagine," writes Rousseau about the Paris Opera,
"an inclosure fifteen feet broad, and long in proportion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
this inclosure is the theatre. On its two sides
are placed at intervals screens, on which are curiously
painted the objects which the scene is about to represent.
At the back of the inclosure hangs a great curtain,
painted in like manner, and nearly always pierced
and torn, that it may represent at a little distance
gulfs on the earth or holes in the sky. Every one
who passes behind this stage, or touches the curtain,
produces a sort of earthquake, which has a double effect.
The sky is made of certain bluish rags, suspended
from poles, or from cords, as linen may be
seen hung out to dry in any washerwoman's yard.
The sun, for it is seen here sometimes, is a lighted
torch in a lantern. The cars of the gods and goddesses
are composed of four rafters, secured and hung
on a thick rope in the form of a swing or see-saw; between
the rafters is a coarse plank, on which the gods
sit down, and in front hangs a piece of coarse cloth,
well dirtied, which acts the part of clouds for the
magnificent car. One may see toward the bottom of
the machine two or three foul candles, badly snuffed,
which, while the greater personage dementedly presents
himself swinging in his see-saw, fumigate him with
incense worthy of his dignity. The agitated sea is
composed of long angular lanterns of cloth and blue
pasteboard, strung on parallel spits, which are turned
by little blackguard boys. The thunder is a heavy
cart, rolled over an arch, and is not the least agreeable
instrument heard at our opera. The flashes of
lightning are made of pinches of resin thrown on a
flame, and the thunder is a cracker at the end of a
fuse. The theatre is, moreover, furnished with little
square traps, which opening at the end, announce
that the demons are about to issue from their cave.
When they have to rise into the air, little demons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
stuffed brown cloth are substituted for them, or sometimes
real chimney-sweeps, who swing about suspended
on ropes, till they are majestically lost in the
rags of which I have spoken."</p>

  <div class="caption">J.&nbsp;K. EMMETT.</div></div>

<p>This sad condition of theatrical illusions cannot be
regarded otherwise than strange when it is recorded
that decorations were of a higher order in the reign
of Louis XIV. Saint-Evremond is authority for the
statement that the sun and moon were so well represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
at the French opera during this period that the
ambassador of Guinea, who assisted at one of the
performances, was decoyed into leaning forward in
his box and religiously saluting the orbs. Had Rousseau
lived to the present day, the wonders and mysteries
of our stage would have made his great heart
leap within him. Modern art and modern mechanism
have brought stage representations so close to nature
that the scenes seem to be small sections, either of
country or city, mountain or vale, lifted from the face
of the world and placed in all their beauty at the
stage-end of the theatre. Managers do not fear to go
to any length in mounting plays properly, and there
is nothing in the outer world that defies reproduction
in the mimic sphere. Steam is freely used; fire
rages fiercely through folds of inflammable canvas;
the lightnings flash; Hendrick Hudson and his men
roll nine-pins in the Catskills, and the low rumble
of the thunder, as the balls rattle down from crag to
crag, is distinctly heard by the audience; poor, demented
old <i>Lear</i> cries to the winds to crack and blow
their cheeks, and they do so to his full satisfaction;
there is genuine rain in the shipwreck scene of "The
Hearts of Oak;" a plentiful fall of the beautiful snow
for "The Two Orphans;" a perfect reproduction of a
mountain rivulet for "The Danites;" steamboat and
railroad explosions of a realistic character in everything;
an almost horizonless sea for the great raft
scene in "The World;" and gorgeous coloring, rich
furniture, choice bric-a-brac, rare paintings and the
Lord only knows what, for the thousand and one
melodramatic and society plays that are now flooding
the stage. Then there are gems apparently rich
enough to have come from the treasuries of Khedive
or Sultan, and robes so redolent of royalty in color<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
and material that the female portion of the audience
is almost driven to distraction in admiring and coveting
them. Little does the average lady patron of
the theatre imagine that the finery she covets is often
the product of the artiste's own needle, and that the
gaiety and glory of an actress's career&mdash;with hundreds
of admirers pouring diamonds into her lap, and hundreds
of others feasting upon her charms, while many
hang with reverence upon the words that fall from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
lips&mdash;is but the merest of dreams; and that the
sister whose professional successes cause her to look
upon the stage as a place of pleasure only, may live
in a tenement surrounded by a poor family to whose
support her life-efforts are devoted; that she has few
admirers; that she is pure as the fairest and purest
woman in private life, and that her only sacrifice is
made to the art which she loves and to which she has
consecrated herself.</p>

<p>There are but few who have not an exaggerated idea
of the value of everything they see upon the stage.
It is true that many actresses are rich enough to wear
diamond necklaces, and to otherwise sprinkle their
persons with brilliants of the first water; but it is
equally true that many others are poor, and that the
gems they wear come from the cheap stock of articles
kept in the theatrical property-room. An amusing
story is told by Olive Logan, who was an actress,
about the false value placed upon stage jewels.</p>

<p>"While I was fulfilling a round of theatrical engagements
in the South, during the war," says Miss
Logan, "I was compelled by 'military necessity,' to
pack up my jewels and send them to Cincinnati. Of
course there were a number of stage trinkets in the
bag as well as some little jewelry of real value, but as
it happened a fabulous idea had got afloat of the value
of my little trinkets, and I was offered large sums for
the carpet sack, 'just as it stood,' after I had packed
it to send it to Cincinnati.</p>

<p>"'I'll give you ten thousand dollars for it without
opening,' said one gentleman; 'I want those ear-rings
for my wife?'</p>

<p>"'No,' I answered, 'no; those things were given
me in France, and I shouldn't like to part with
them.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
"'Are the ear-rings in here?'"</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I answered.</p>

<p>"'And the bracelet?'"</p>

<p>"'Yes.'"</p>

<div id="ip_60" class="figcenter" style="width: 326px;">
  <img src="images/i_168.jpg" width="326" height="380" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">KATHERINE ROGERS.</div></div>

<p>"'Fifteen thousand&mdash;will you?'"</p>

<p>"'No, no,' I answered, and the matter ended. I
couldn't help laughing, for truly I might have made a
sharp bargain if I had wished. Somebody would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
been sold, and that somebody not myself. I returned
to Cincinnati after my trip to Nashville, and there
found my effects awaiting me in good order. One day
in the Burnet House I was accosted by a pleasant-looking
gentleman, who informed me that he had taken
charge of the bag from Louisville to Cincinnati.</p>

<p>"'Did not Mr. &mdash;&mdash; send it by express?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'No. I was coming up, and he thought it best to
entrust it to me.'</p>

<p>"'I'm very much obliged to you,' I said.</p>

<p>"'Indeed, you have cause to be,' he said, good-naturedly.
'I give you my word it's the last time I'll
have on my mind the charge of fifty thousand dollars'
worth of diamonds.'"</p>

<p>After an English lady of rank returned from the
continent, she found her trunk robbed of its jewels.
Detectives traced the jewels to a London pawnshop,
where they had been sold for $5. The thieves were
arrested, and when one of them was asked why he had
been so foolish as to sell nearly one hundred thousand
dollars' worth of diamonds for $5, he answered:
"Why, yer honor, we never thought for a minute as
how they were real jewels; we just thought the lady
was some play-actor woman, and that the whole lot
wasn't worth but a few shillings."</p>

<p>The trinkets are no more deceptive than are many
other means employed to astonish and gladden the
public. The production of thunder, the simulation of
rain-fall, the fictitious roaring of winds, and the multiplication
of suns, moons and stars are among the
numerous illusions that give to the theatre that marvellous
charm under whose spell thousands are nightly
placed and held. In the olden times these effects were
produced in a simple and by no means mystifying
manner, but late years have made them so perfect in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
their application that none but the initiated can even
begin to think out the solution of the wondrous effects
in which the stage now abounds. A new effect, such
as the enormous stretch of sea and sky to be found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
"The World," is something that dramatic authors and
stage mechanics are always seeking after and are glad
to find. The revolving tower in "The Shaughran"
was a puzzle to everybody. Now there are hundreds
of effects of this kind with folding and vanishing scenes
that are even more wonderful than Boucicault's tower.
Viewed from the wings the simplicity of the means
employed to produce these effects makes them absolutely
laughable. They shall be explained in this
chapter.</p>

<p>Thunder-storms are common efforts at realism, and
they are sometimes simulated in a way that makes
them appear to fall very little short of nature. The
earliest style of stage thunder was effected by vigorously
shaking a piece of sheet iron which made a rattling
and ear-disturbing noise. Even now when a
show is "on the road" and a hall without the usual
first-class accessories must be used, the audience, and
the actor too, must be satisfied with sheet-iron thunder.
The modern invention is known as the thunder-drum,
and it stands over the prompter's desk where
it can be easily reached by a long stick with a thick,
soft padding at the end&mdash;similar to the sticks used in
beating bass-drums. The thunder-drum consists of a
calf-skin tightly drawn over the top of a box frame.
With this instrument the low rumbling of distant thunder
or the long roll of the elemental disturbance may
be attained, and, following the sharp rattling of the
shaken sheet of iron and the flash of ignited magnesium
an effect is produced that completely awes the
simple citizen who knows nothing of the mechanism of
the stage.</p>

<p>The prompter, too, who by the way is a most responsible
person among the individuals who populate
the mimic world, has control of the rain machine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
This is a wooden cylinder, about two feet in diameter,
and four or five feet long. It is filled with dried peas
which rattle against wooden teeth in its inside surface,
as the machine, which is in the "flies," is operated by
a belt running down to the prompter's desk. This
reminds me that I have used the expression "flies"
several times without explaining what is meant. The
"flies" is a term used to designate the scenery and
spaces above the stage, and as there is a great deal of
it, it has as much importance in a theatrical sense as
any other part of the back of the house. Well, to
resume the explanation, the prompter has the rain
machine in the "flies" fully under control and can
turn out any kind of a rain-storm the play may
require; if a swirl of the aqueous downpour is needed,&mdash;such
a manifestation of wrathy lachrymoseness as you
find in a storm that at intervals beats mercilessly
against your windows and the side of your house,&mdash;one
good, strong, sharp pull at the rope will effect it.
Less atrocious efforts of the elements may be obtained
with a slighter exertion of muscle at the rope or belt.
The wind machine is a very necessary adjunct of these
storm effects, and it is to be found in every large theatre,
furnishing "a nipping and an eager air" or one
of those howling blasts that make night desolate and
day disastrous. The wind machine may be moved to
any part of the stage. Sometimes it is behind the
door of a hut through which snow is fiercely driven,
and at other times it may be in the side scenes, or any
locality to which or through which the storm is rushing.
It is an awful funny thing to the man at the wind
machine to think of the cold chill he sends down the
back of the sensitive play-goer as the wind whistles
across the scene in which poor blind <i>Louise</i>, in the
"Two Orphans," figures, or that scene in "Ours"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
where <i>Lord Shendryn</i> is at the mercy of the pitiless
storm. The wind that makes the warm blood frigid
under such circumstances is very easily constructed.
A cylinder from which extend paddles is set in a suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
frame and above its top is stretched a piece of
grosgrain silk. The silk is stationary, but the cylinder
and paddles are operated by means of a crank and
sometimes by a "crank." Swift motion produces
woeful gusts of the windy article, and a steady blast
may be duplicated by patiently working the machine.
When the property-man is driven to the necessity of
providing rain and wind in theatrical districts that do
not boast of modern appliances he obtains a rain effect
by rolling bird-shot over brown paper that has been
pasted around a hoop, and the wind is raised by swinging
around a heavy piece of gas-hose. This kind of
thing is called "faking" the wind or rain.</p>

<p>When real water is used on the stage to simulate
rain, as in the first act of the "Hearts of Oak," or
"Oaken Hearts," as they at one time tried to call a
pirated edition of it, the effect is obtained by carrying
water to the stage lofts, during the day, where it remains
in a tank connected with a long piece of perforated
pipe, back of the proscenium border, and
stretching across the stage. At night when the proper
time arrives the water is allowed to run into the pipe,
from which it of course falls in numerous small streams
upon a rubber tarpaulin that has been stretched below
to receive it. So too in mountain rivulets with "real
water," as in "The Danites," a tank in the loft must
be filled daily with water to supply the nightly scene.
In all instances of this sort the effect is quite realistic,
and never fails to meet with a hearty appreciation by
the audience.</p>

<p>The snow-storm is also usually a pleasing stage picture,
and is brought about in a most simple manner.
White paper is cut into very small pieces, which are
carefully treasured by the property-man, whose duty
it is to see to everything of this kind in and around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
the stage, and who regards the manufacture of a snow-storm
as a very slow and tedious piece of work. When
the snow is ready it is placed in what is called the
snow-box, a long narrow affair with slats on the bottom
leaving room enough for the pieces of paper to sift
through, when the box is given a swaying motion.
The contrivance is swung over the stage by means of
two ropes, and is operated by a third leading to one
side of the stage. When the chilled heroine comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
upon the scene amid a terrible fall of snow and draws
her thin garments tightly over her shoulder, while she
shivers, the snow-box up above is swinging to and fro,
and the white flakes are only bits of paper frauds that
the property-man or an assistant will carefully sweep
up after the scene or act, to do duty again the following
night and for many a night to come.</p>

<p>The snow-storm and the other illusions described
above are only a fraction of the things the property-man
has to look after and keep in order. He has
charge of everything upon the stage and is responsible
for everything except the scenery. When a play is
running that requires handsome appointments, it is his
business to provide. Within the past decade or so of
years it has become the custom to borrow expensive
furniture from generous local dealers who are often
satisfied with the simple and easy remuneration of a
line or two acknowledging the loan, in the programme;
or a certain price is paid for the use of the furniture
during the run of the play; or the set is purchased
outright from the dealer and repurchased by him at a
reduction when the theatre is done with it. Nearly
all theatres, however, are supplied with suitably handsome
furniture for an ordinary society play, and it is only
when gorgeousness is aimed at that managers are obliged
to borrow. Pistols, knives, helmets, lances, battle-axes,
canes, cigars, money, pocket-books, the vial from
which Juliet takes the fatal draught, the marble or
majolica pedestals, the rich vases, sunflowers such as
are used in the æsthetic play of "The Colonel," the
paste-board ham, the tin cups, or cut glasses that the
characters drink from, fire-place, mantel, and looking-glass&mdash;these,
and many other articles the property-man
furnishes the players, either placing the stationary
fixtures on the stage, or sending the call-boy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
the performers with the articles they require. The
check-book that the rich banker draws from his pocket
when he hands $100,000, more or less, over to somebody
else in the play, the quill or pen he writes the
check with, and the bottle out of which he dips the
imaginary ink, all come from the property-room, and
go back to it again after the act is over. A list of the
articles required for a play is furnished the property-man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
when a play is to be put on, and these articles he
must have when the prompter calls or sends for them.
Sometimes the property-man forgets, and then there
is trouble in the camp. It is related that having forgotten
to provide a Juliet with her vial of poison, in
time, the article being called for as the actress was
about to go on the stage, the property-man snatched
up the first thing that looked like a vial that he got his
eyes on. It was a bottle from the prompter's desk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
and when Juliet placed the awful draught to her lips
and took a pull at the bottle, she discovered to her
horror that she had swallowed a dose of ink. The actress,
who tells the story herself in her autobiography,
said, she wanted to "swallow a sheet of blotting-paper,"
when she made the inky discovery.</p>

<p>I find in Miss Logan's book from which I have before
quoted in this chapter, the following funny inventory of
properties furnished a new lessee of the Drury Lane
Theatre, London: "Spirits of wine, for flames and
apparitions, £12 2<i>s.</i>; three and one-half bottles of
lightning, £&mdash;; one snow-storm, of finest French paper,
3<i>s.</i>; two snow-storms of common French paper, 2<i>s.</i>;
complete sea, with twelve long waves, slightly damaged,
£1 10<i>s.</i>; eighteen clouds, with black edges, in
good order, 12<i>s.</i>, 6<i>d.</i>; rainbow, slightly faded, 2<i>s.</i>;
an assortment of French clouds, flashes of lightning
and thunder-bolts, 15<i>s.</i>; a new moon, slightly tarnished,
15<i>s.</i>; imperial mantle, made for Cyrus, and
subsequently worn by Julius Cæsar and Henry VIII.,
10<i>s.</i>; Othello's handkerchief, 6<i>d.</i>; six arm-chairs
and six flower-plots, which dance country dances, £2."
The same author adds another quotation that gives a
better idea of the quantity and character of the property-man's
possessions, <span class="locked">saying:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"He has charge of all the movables and has to exercise
the greatest ingenuity in getting them up. His
province is to preserve the canvas water from getting
wet, keep the sun's disk clear and the moon from
getting torn; he manufactures thunder on sheet iron,
or from parchment stretched drum-like on a frame; he
prepares boxes of dried peas for rain and wind, and
huge watchman's rattles for the crash of falling towers.
He has under his charge demijohns for the fall
of concealed china in cupboards; speaking trumpets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
to imitate the growl of ferocious wild beasts; penny
whistles for the 'cricket on the hearth;' powdered
rosin for lightning flashes, where gas is not used; rose
pink, for the blood of patriots; money, cut out of tin;
finely cut bits of paper for fatal snow-storms; ten-pin
balls, for the distant mutterings of a storm; bags of
gold containing bits of broken glass and pebbles, to
imitate the musical ring of coin; balls of cotton wadding
for apple dumplings; links of sausages, made of
painted flannel; sumptuous boquets of papier mache;
block-tin rings with painted beads puttied in for royal
signets; crowns of Dutch gilding lined with red ferret;
broomstick handles cut up for truncheons for command;
brooms themselves for witches to ride; branches of
cedar for Birnam wood; dredging boxes of flour for
the fate-desponding lovers; vermilion to tip the noses
of jolly landlords; pieces of rattan silvered over for
fairy wands; leaden watches, for gold repeaters; dog-chains
for the necks of knighthood, and tin spurs for
its heels; armor made of leather, and shields of wood;
fans for ladies to coquet behind; quizzing-glasses, for
exquisites to ogle with; legs of mutton, hams, loaves
of bread and plum-puddings, all cut from canvas, and
stuffed with sawdust; together with all the pride,
pomp, and circumstance of a dramatic display. Such
is the property-man of a theatre. He bears his honors
meekly; he mixes molasses and water for wine and
darkens it a little shade for brandy; is always busy
behind the scenes, but is seldom seen, unless it is to
clear the stage, and then what a shower of yells and
hisses does he receive from the galleries! The
thoughtless gods cry 'Supe! Supe!' which if intended
for an abbreviation of superior or superfine, may be
opposite, but in no other view of the case. What
would a theatre be without a property-man? A world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
without a sun * * * Kings would be truncheonless
and crownless; brigands without spoils; old
men without canes and powder; Harlequin without
his hat; Macduff without his leafy screen; theatres
would close&mdash;there would be no tragedy, no comedy,
no farce without him. Jove in his chair was never
more potent than he. An actor might, and often does
get along without the words of his part, but not without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
the properties. What strange quandaries have we
seen the Garricks and Siddonses of our stage get into
when the property-man lapsed in his duty! We have
seen Romeo distracted because the bottle of poison was
not to be found; Virginius tear his hair because the
butcher's knife was not ready on the shambles; Baillie
Nicol Jarvie nonplussed because there was no red-hot
poker to singe the Tartan fladdie with; Macbeth
frowning because the Eighth Apparition did not bear a
glass to show him any more; William Tell in agony
because there was no small apple for Gesler to pick;
the First Murderer in distress because there was no
blood for his face ready; Hecate fuming like a hellcat
because her car did not mount easily; Richard the
Third grinding his teeth because the clink of hammers
closing rivets up was forgotten; Hamlet brought up
all standing because there was no goblet to drink the
poison from, and Othello stabbing Iago with a candlestick
because he had no other sword of Spain, the
Ebro's temper, to do the deed with. So, the property-man
is no insignificant personage&mdash;he is the mainspring
which sets all the work in motion; and an actor
had better have a bad epitaph when dead than his ill
will while living."</p>

<p>A few companies have done away entirely with the
canvas-outlined turkey and the sawdust-stuffed dumpling,
and have meals that figure in the play served on
the stage piping hot from some neighboring restaurant.
There is genuine wine too, and often it is champagne
of such quality that its sparkle makes the eyes
of the tipplers in the audience dance, and their mouths
run water. In this and many other ways the desire to
get as near to the real thing as possible in art has
caused encroachments on the property-man's territory,
and gradually his treasures are decreasing. Still
his occupation is not as gone as Othello's. Travelling
combinations have their own property-man, and the
theatres each carry one. Besides the magnificent
work of producing snow-storms from paper, etc., there
are minor details of his business that he brings as
much art to as the average actor and actress take to
the stage. He builds a warrior's helmet from simple
brown manilla paper and makes a pair of bronze urns
in the same cheap way, although they may appear to
be worth $300. Bronze figures, too, are obtained
from the same material; also flower-pots, mantelpieces,
and such things. He goes about the work like
an artist. He first makes a model in clay of the article&mdash;say
it is an urn. This done he builds a wooden
box around it, and mixing plaster of paris and water
pours the mixture between the box and model where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
it is allowed to harden. After the clay mould has been
withdrawn the plaster of paris mould is greased, and
five successive coats of small pieces of thick brown
paper that have been soaked in water are carefully laid
on. A layer of muslin and glue follows, and three
more coats of the brown paper. When the application
has thoroughly dried, the last three layers of
brown paper are removed, and the urn which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
four days in process of completion is ready for use.
Goblets for royal or knightly banquets are manufactured
by the property-man in the same manner. Often
has a golden goblet, ewer, amphora, or salver fallen
to the floor from the hands of awkward Ganymedes
and Hebes without creating any consternation among
the gathered gallants, or making a sound loud enough
to ripple above the lightest notes of the orchestra.
These properties are light, but very durable, and well
withstand the harsh and careless treatment they frequently
receive. Often the entire "banquet set" is
made of paper, the skilled work of the worthy property-man,
who holds probably the most independent
place in the theatre, being obliged to carry no article
to anybody&mdash;not even a foreign star&mdash;but leaves that
menial work to the stage manager, prompter, or call-boy.</p>

<p>Moonlight is one of the most poetical and beautiful
of stage effects. The first work in producing it is
done by the scenic artist, who places a moonlight picture
on his canvas. The calcium light filtered through
a green glass fills the foreground with its mellow influence.
At the back of the stage a row of argand
burners with light green shades, gives the faint and soft
touches that fill in the distance. A "ground piece"
or strip of scenery runs along the floor at the back of
the stage, and just under the main scene hides the
"green mediums," as the shaded burners are called,
from the eyes of the audience. Sometimes the row is
above the stage, and protected from sight by the
"sky-borders." Silver ripples on the surface of
water, and twinkling stars in the sky are frequently
made features of moonlight scenery. The twinkling
stars are bright spangles hung by pin-hooks to the
scenes, and the ripples are only slits in the water canvas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
behind which an endless towel with slits cut in its
surface and a strong gaslight between the rollers and
the sides of the towel, is made to revolve. Every
time the slits in the towel came opposite the slits in
the canvas the light shines through and the silver
dance upon the lake or river. When the slits in the
towel are made to move upward the ripples seem to
lift their silvery tops towards the bending sky. Moonrise,
which is always an agreeable illusion, even to
those who know how it is done, is effected by lifting
the "moon-box," as it is carried slowly up behind a
muslin canvas, upon which heavy paper is fastened to
represent clouds. The "moon-box" is an ordinary
cubial affair with a round hole at one end, over which
a strip of muslin is fastened, and behind which is a
strong illumination. Two wires from above are manipulated
causing the moon to move through its orbit.
When its path lies behind one of the paper clouds the
fraudulent Cynthia, just like the genuine queen of the
heavens, fails to shine, but as soon as she emerges from
the dark spot and the outer ruin of the illuminated circular
surface of the "moon-box" touches the white
muslin once again, she is the fair queen of night and
the young lovers in the audience feel as happy as if
they were at home swinging on the front gate, while
pa is at the club and ma is entertaining an amiable
cousin in the second parlor. The flushed countenance
of the moon, as she is just rising from Thetis's arms,
as you see her every night when she is taking her first
dainty steps up the eastern sky, is obtained by having
the lower edge of the muslin painted red and gradually
blending with the white, while floating clouds are
only the result of hanging or sewing on the gauze drop
in front of the muslin screen, pieces of muslin or canvas
cut into the proper shapes. The change from day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
night, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versa</i>, effects that surpass the other in
real beauty, and also in attractiveness for the public,
is produced by having a drop twice the usual length,
painted one half in a sunset and the other half in moonlight.
If the change from day to night, which is the
more effective, is desired, the sunset sky occupies the
upper half of the drop&mdash;that is nothing but the sunset
sky is presented to the eyes of the audience. The distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
scenery is painted upon a separate piece and the
outlines of the objects are sharply cut out so that the
sunset sky can be seen above the irregular outline of
the horizon. A gauze drop hangs in front to give the
picture the required hazy effect, and red lights give a
sunset glow to the entire scene. Rolling up the back
drop the change is made slowly and carefully until the
moon is discovered in the night half of the sky and
goes up with it, while the usual moonlight mediums
are brought into requisition to increase the brightness
of the view.</p>

<p>There are two ways of producing ocean waves.
Sometimes a piece of blue cloth with dashes of white
paint for wave-crests covers the entire stage, when the
necessary motion of the waters is obtained by having
men or boys stationed in the entrances to sway the sea.
Again, each billow may be made to show separate
with the alternate rows of billows rearing their white
crests between the tips of the row on each side.
These billows are rocked backward and forward&mdash;to
and from the audience&mdash;while the ocean's roar comes
from a wooden box lined with tin and containing a
small quantity of bird shot. The desired sound is
produced by rolling the box around.</p>

<p>Anybody who has witnessed Milton Noble's "Phœnix"
properly placed on the stage, or "The Streets
of New York," must have been, the first time, both
terrified, and still somewhat delighted, with the fire
scenes. Of late years they have been made wonderfully
thrilling, and almost perfect fac-similes of the
Fire Fiend himself. The scene-painter gets up his
house in three pieces. The roof is swung from the
"flies"; the front wall is in two pieces, a jagged
line running from near the top of one side of the scene
to the lower end of the other side. If shutters are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
fall, as in "The Streets of New York," they are fastened
to the scene with "quick match," a preparation
of powder, alcohol, and lamp wick. Iron window and
door frames are covered with oakum soaked in alcohol
or other fire-quickening fluid. Steam is made to
represent smoke, and the steam itself is obtained by
dissolving lime in water. A platform from the side
affords a footing to the firemen who are fighting the
flames in the very midst of the burning building, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
an endless towel with painted flames keeps moving
across the picture after the first wall and roof have
been allowed to fall in, while red fire plays upon the
whole picture and "flash torches" are made to represent
leaping tongues of flame. There appears to be a
great deal of danger from the operation of a scene of
this kind, but if proper care is taken the danger is as
worthy of consideration as that attending the presentation
of a parlor scene.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE RAFT SCENE.</div></div>

<p>"The World" has been pronounced a novelty in
scenic effects. I went behind the scenes to see how
the thing worked, and had the pleasure of finding out
all about it. The play is in seven set scenes. The first
had nothing unusual in it except that the ship with full
steam on and the dock was produced very artistically.
The ship and the buildings were in profile with a good
stretch of sky beyond, that was all. Next came the
explosion scene, when the vessel was, by the supposed
use of dynamite, sent flying in splinters in mid-ocean,
and all save four souls went down to the briny depths.
The mere ship setting, with its boilers, its hatches, its
galleries, spars and guys, was worthy of admiration.
While the performers were leading up to the point
where the awful and fateful moment comes, a man sat
quietly behind the scenes ready to fire an anvil of
guns, each charged to the muzzle; men stood at the
numerous openings in the rear, and men with chemical
red-fire occupied the side-scenes, while others with
powdered lycopodium were under the stage beneath a
half-dozen grated openings. At the left, in the wings,
stood an array of "supers," to rush on and increase
the commotion when the shock came. When the
heavy villain announced that there was a dynamite
machine on board, and the captain gave orders to his
men to overhaul everything below and try to find it&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>then
the thunder came. Bang went the young cannons
in the rear. The stage shook, and the theatre
seemed ready to fall about our ears; the females
shrieked; the "supers" rushed on and shouted; then
came the leaping flames from below and from the
sides, until, finally, the whole picture was one burning
glow and whirl of smoke, and the curtain came down
in time, I suppose, to prevent a panic, for women
shrieked, and men got up from their seats to flee from
the theatre. Act three brought the grandest illusion
of all&mdash;the great raft scene. This picture shows a
raft tossing on a rolling ocean with a vast stretch of
sea on all sides, the sky and waters apparently meeting
as far away as if they were realities and not mere attempts
at nature. This scene always struck me with
awe until I saw it from the stage. The second act
at an end, the stage manager has the stage cleared in
a short time; then the carpenter and his assistants go
to work. A "ground piece" of sea is placed across
the stage at the first entrance. All the side scenes are
removed and a huge curtain of light blue is hung in a
semi-circle from one side of the stage, up around to
the rear and then down to the other side. A couple of
men now come down to the centre of the stage bearing
something that looks like an old barn-door with four
swinging legs, one at each corner. A pivot is fastened on
the stage; the barn door is balanced on it and down
through four small openings in the stage go the four
arms or legs, at points corresponding with the four
corners of the door. I can see now that the upper
side of the door bears a slight resemblance to a rude
raft, the timber being artistically painted upon its surface.
Somebody sticks a pole in the side up the stage.
A box is placed at one end for the villain who is among
the saved; a cushion is furnished at the other end for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
the young lady who plays the lad, <i>Ned</i>; <i>Old Owen</i>,
the miner, lies along the lower side and <i>Sir Clement
Huntingford</i>, the hero, takes his stand at the mast,
pale and haggard with hunger and anxiety. The sea
cloth, covering the stage except for a rectangular
aperture that goes around the raft and has its edges
fastened to the raft, is spread; boys crawl under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
sea and lie upon their backs; men stand in the
side scenes holding the ragged edges of the already
white-crested sea. Everything is ready now, and amid
the right kind of music the curtain goes up on the
magnificent raft scene. Four men under the stage
have hold of the four pieces hanging from the corners
of the raft, and by pulling in exact line give it the
motion of the heaving sea; the men in the side scenes
agitate the blue cloth and the boys beneath it toss and
roll the cloth with hands and feet. <i>Old Owen</i> dies
before <i>Sir Clement</i> sights a ship no bigger than a star
away off in the horizon. He ties a rag to the mast for
a signal; but the ship keeps moving past, until at last,
to the despair of all on board the raft, it is about to
dip below the horizon. But it suddenly tacks; there
is a tiny rocket seen curving in the air; the ship has
noticed the signal of distress and down comes the curtain
upon the happy trio left alive on board their storm-tossed
and frail raft. Passing over two acts that are
only eventful the sixth comes, which represents the
yard of a lunatic asylum, with two great walls on
either side of an iron gate that is set well up the stage,
and through which a stretch of the River Thames and
the overhanging sky are seen. <i>Sir Clement</i>, who is
the rightful heir to certain property, has been confined
here through the machinations of his brother, who is in
possession, and of another scoundrel. Here, though,
the hero makes his escape by knocking the officers right
and left and bounding through the gate; in a moment
the walls part and a house with cornices and wide projections
folds together like a stuffed valentine that has
been sat upon. One of the walls moves off the stage
to the left, the other to the right, each moving in an
arc of a circle, and the whole disappearing from the
stage, while <i>Sir Clement</i> is discovered paddling safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
down the Thames from his pursuers. The walls are
moved from the stage through the agency of men
stationed inside. Rollers are provided for the scenic
structures, and there are two men inside of each piece,
the one in advance having a lookout hole and acting as
guide. The only thing attractive in the last act is an
elevator in the Palace Hotel. This is a simple mechanical
effect, however, and needs no explanation. I
should have said in describing the sea that the horizon
rises gradually from the stage to a height of about
three feet at the back, and the sail that is sighted is a
tiny ship mounted on a frame work on rollers and
pulled across the stage by a small cord. This raft
scene is all that has been claimed for it, and the illusion
has not its equal on the stage. The revolving
tower in "The Shaughraun," and the vanishing scene
in "Youth," are both worked in the same manner as
the lunatic asylum walls in "The World."</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ARMY OF ATTACHES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>I have already written about the property-man, his
many duties, and the great responsibility that rests
upon him. I have also written about the prompter,
and the vast amount of work he is required to do. But
there remain behind the scenes and in the body of the
house, other persons who go to make up the grand
army of theatrical attaches, and whose place in the
amusement world is one of some importance, as they
are the adjuncts without which the drama would be
left naked of its present beauty and splendor and the
circumstances under which it would be patronized
would be full of inconvenience and discomfort. The
door-keepers of theatres are often interesting characters.
Sometimes they have been selected outside the
ranks of the profession, when, of course, they have
little more to tell you about than the habits and peculiarities
of the theatre-going public; but many of them
are broken-down actors,&mdash;actors who have been
"crushed," and in whose better days vistas of
unlimited hope opened before their dazzled vision.
These are full of reminiscences of the old-time saints
of the sock and buskin. If one could believe all they
have to say, these victims of circumstances could be
looked upon as individuals whose destiny it had
originally been to knock their shiny stove-pipe hats
against the stars of heaven, but, by some strange fatality,
had their backs broken and their majestic tread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
lamed, so that now they can only shuffle into a free-lunch
saloon and bend their necks over the counter as
they lovingly embrace a schooner of beer. There is
always room at the bottom for the unfortunates of the
profession, and they find such provision usually made
for them, as taking tickets at the door, or working
outside among the newspaper boys in the capacity of
agent. The treasurer of a theatre and the ticket seller,
who, in the broad sense of the word, may be looked
upon as attaches, are people that all patrons of theatres
are familiar with. They, with the door-keeper,
must in the blandest manner at their command resist
the advances of the very numerous dead-heads. A
courteous refusal is always deemed the best, but frequently
the harshest treatment must be resorted to to
get rid of this theatrical nuisance, of whom I shall take
occasion to speak later on, as well as of the free-pass
system. The treasurer of a theatre is always on terms
of intimacy with the professionals who frequent his
house, and is usually a jolly-featured, good-natured
man who knows how to entertain his friends, to retain
the good opinion of his manager, while filling up the
ticket-box with passes, and who understands and appreciates
the full value of the saying that a soft answer
turneth aside wrath. His salary ranges from $25 to
$50 a week, while a good ticket-seller, who frequently
is made to do all the hard work, may be had for $12
or $15. A door-keeper is paid from $10 to $15 a
week.</p>

<p>The great American type of youthful citizen, with all
the manners and dignity of old age and the advisory
qualities of a Nestor, is the theatrical usher&mdash;the
young chap who takes your reserved seat ticket with a
smile full of malignity and succeeds in getting you
into the wrong chair and almost into a prize fight with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
every man who comes into the same row of seats. He
does this graciously and with such an exhibition of
carefulness in comparing the number on your coupon
with the number of the chair, that you actually feel
ashamed of yourself to have made a mistake after what
appeared to you to be an honest, vigorous, and successful
effort to show you what was right. The ushers
in Western cities are mere boys in uniform; in the
East they are young men, and at Haverly's, Wallack's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
and other first-class New York establishments,
you will find them in full evening dress with as large
an exhibition of shirt front as the swellest of the
society noodles who are among the patrons of the
house. The usher gets $6 or $8 a week, but
impresses the stranger as if he owned an interest in the
theatre. He may sell calico or run a lemonade stand
during the day, but at night he is master of all he surveys,
talks of the actresses as familiarly as if he were
a blood relation, tries to make you believe he has "a
solid girl" in the ballet, and will offer you any favor,
from an introduction to the star to a dozen matinee-passes
or a game of seven-up with the manager. Like
the claquers, he is a regular nuisance. After the first
act he will sit or stand and give his opinion of the play,
commenting upon the performers in such brief, half
ejaculatory, half interrogatory way, as, "Ain't she a
daisy, though?" or, "Ain't he a dandy, you bet?"
He is expected to applaud even the vilest and least
deserving things, and when the cue is given, works his
hands and feet as vigorously as I have often seen
Henry Mapleson in applauding Marie Roze, his wife,
or a travelling manager in commending the efforts of
his favorite among the females of his company.</p>

<p>Down in front, right under the glow of the foot-lights,
the bald head of the leader of the orchestra
shines. Often he is interesting, but sometimes, especially
among the leaders for combinations on the
road, he has a life history that compels now tears and
now again laughter. When he is on the road he may
have a wife or daughter in the company, and if he has
neither he is bound to look lovingly upon some of the
fair talent whose toes twinkle, or voices ripple in song to
the tune of his waving baton, and he will smile out
through his gold-rimmed spectacles upon his favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
even while she is courting the favor of the audience, or,
perhaps, while she is trying to mash some beefy blonde
in the front rows of the parquette. Jealousy often takes
possession of the breast of the orchestra leader. It
may be that he will find out that the wife he has done
everything for to make famous has younger and handsomer
lovers, from whose glowing presence she comes
to her musical lord cold as a Christmas morning with
eighteen inches of ice on pond and river; or it may be
that the favorite of the foot-lights whom he adores has
found another favorite in the audience; then there is
war, and sometimes the orchestra is left without its
leader and a story of unrequited love is told in a coroner's
inquest held upon a body found floating in a
pool, or hanging from a transom in the room of some
hotel. To leave the pathetic and get down to solid
facts it may be stated that the leader of an orchestra
is paid from $75 to $100 a week, and has from a dozen
to sixteen musicians whose salaries range from $18 to
$30 a week.</p>

<p>Again returning to the bosom of the stage&mdash;to the
sacred precincts beyond the foot-lights&mdash;we encounter
the stage manager. Every travelling company has its
own employee who directs and runs the stage business,
and notwithstanding the abolition of stock companies,
several theatres retain stage managers of their own
who work in conjunction with the company's, looking
after the setting of scenery, bossing the stage hands,
etc. The stage manager may be an actor, or he may
not, but he must be a man of theatrical training, and
thoroughly conversant with all the requirements of the
stage. In travelling combinations he usually plays a
minor part, and, although he may not be able to act as
well as his brethren of the play, he must possess the
requisite artistic knowledge to point out and dictate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
what all shall do. He supervises rehearsals; casts
plays,&mdash;that is, assigns to each performer his character;
and he looks after the mounting of plays and the costuming,
giving the scenic artist the period to which the
play belongs, and imparting the same information to
the costumers so that there may be no anachronism in
the representation on the stage.</p>

  <div class="caption">HELPING THE SCENE PAINTER.</div></div>

<p>The scenic artist, who is often known to the people
only by his work, has some extraordinary duties to
perform. When a combination or company has a date
at a theatre a week or so beforehand, they send on
small models of the scenery they require for their play.
These models greatly resemble in their general appearance
and size the toy theatres that are sold to children.
The stage carpenter, who goes around day and night
treading the stage in his own shuffling and careless
way, and who is entirely unknown to the public, takes
the models and builds frames over which canvas or
muslin is spread. Then the canvas-covered frame is
taken to the scene painter's bridge when it is ready for
the colors. In many theatres the bridge is a platform
extending across the stage, and distant from the rear
wall about a foot. It is on a level with the flies, and
the opening between it and the rear wall is used for
lowering and hoisting a scene, which is hung on a large
wooden frame while the artist is at work upon it.
This frame moves up and down, being swung on pulleys.
The most improved theatres East and West, in
addition to having the dressing-rooms, engines, etc.,
in a building separate from the theatre, have the paint
bridge also separate. Great iron doors, three or four
stories high, close the opening to the painting establishment,
and all scenery not in use on the stage
during the run of a play is stored in the space under
the bridge, while the bridge itself is really a long narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
room with an opening at one side of a foot or less,
through which communication is had with the storeroom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
and which gives space for the operation of the
frames upon which scenes are painted. The artist's
palette is a long table with compartments at the back
for different colors, and there is besides a profusion of
paint cans, jars, etc., with huge brushes that might
serve the whitewasher's wide-spread purpose, and
others thin enough to paint a lady's eye-lash. Water-colors
are used, and great splotches of it are found
along the lengthy palette. The removal of the paint-bridge
from the stage is a blessing to actors and
actresses alike, for often during a performance at night
or a rehearsal in the morning broadcloths and silks received
dashes of paint from the brush of the man at
work in mid-air. Still actresses do not often keep shy
of the paint-bridge. The ballet-girls are sometimes
to be found there amusing themselves with the artist
and his assistants, and they tell the story of two New
York actresses who actually put on aprons, took hold
of the big brushes, and assisted a scenic artist in
"priming" his canvas. They were bantering him
about the slow progress he was making with a scene
that was wanted that night, when he remarked: "If
you are in such a hurry for the scene, why don't you
come up here and help me?" They accepted the invitation
at once, and went to work in the manner I
have suggested. The scene was ready that night, but
the actresses were very tired. They painted no more.</p>

<p>The "priming" of a scene which I have mentioned
in the preceding anecdote, consists in laying a coat of
white mixed with sizing upon the canvas. When this
is dry the artist outlines his scene in charcoal. He
first gets his perspective, which he does by attaching a
long piece of twine to a pin fixed at his "vanishing
point." Then blackening the string and beginning at
the top he snaps it so as to make a black line which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
afterwards gone over with ink. This line is reproduced
whenever the drawing requires, and the advantage
it affords will be readily understood by all who
know anything about art or appreciate the value of
good perspective in drawing. The sky of the scene is
first filled in rapidly with a whitewash brush, after which
follows a swift but clever completion of the view.
The side scenes which are to be used as continuations
of the "flat," as the principal or back part of a scene
is called, must be in perspective with the rest of the
picture. Scenic artists work very quickly, and can
prepare a view in a very short time. Morgan, Marston,
Fox, and Voegtlin, in New York; Goatcher, in
Cincinnati; and Dick Halley, Tom Noxon, and Ernest
Albert, in St. Louis, are among the best scene painters
in the country. The salaries paid in this branch of
the profession vary from $40 to $150 a week. A New
York artist, it is said, who works very fast, receives as
much as $100 to $150 for one or two scenes. When it
is taken into consideration that at the end of the run
of a play these scenes are blotted out to make way for
others, the price paid for them is simply enormous.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE "OLD WOMAN" OF THE COMPANY.</div></div>

<p>The old woman of the company is an elderly
matronly female, who may be found hovering in the
wings of every theatre. She is nobody's mother in
particular, but talks in a motherly way to all, and exercises
a special supervision over the female members
of the company. In strange contrast to her is the
call-boy, a mischievous devil-may-care young fellow,
who calls Booth "Ed," Bernhardt "Sallie," and has
familiar appellations for the most prominent and dignified
people in the profession. It is his business to call
performers from the green-room in time for them to
take their "cue" for going on the stage, and this is
about all he has to do except to make trouble, to learn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>secrets that he whispers about, and to become an impish
nuisance revelling in more fun and freedom than
anybody else behind the scenes. Aimee took a liking
to one of these little gentlemen once and fed him
cigarettes, and let him tell her lies <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad libitum</i>. She
said she liked him because he was such "a charming
little beast." Alice Oates, of flagrant fame, allowed
one of them out West to get into her good graces, and
repented it, when she found that he disappeared suddenly
one day with a lot of her jewels. The call-boy
comes last in the list of attaches, but he is not at all
least. If you believe all he tells you, like the usher,
you will think him a great man, for he often boasts of
playing poker with John McCullough, of taking Lotta
out for a drive, or of rolling ten-pins with Salvini or
some equally illustrious representative of the highest
dramatic art. A call-boy gets about $10 a week, and
in five cases out of ten he isn't worth ten cents.</p>

</div>

<p>George McManus, treasurer of the Grand Opera
House, St. Louis, in addition to being a good story-teller,
is as fond of a practical joke as he is of three
meals a day. During the season of 1880&ndash;81 George
was at the box-office window, one day, looking out at
the Dutch lager beer saloon across the street, and
wondering why it was that people were so fond of
"schooners," when a tall, thin, melancholy, Hamlet-like
young fellow, with the air and clothes of rusticity,
stalked slowly into the vestibule and up to the box-office.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said George, as the young man got in
front of the window and fixed his elbows on the sill.</p>

<p>"I want to be an actor," the young man began;
"I kem here from Cahokia, a small place you may
have heern about, and I'd like to go on the stage and
play somethin' or other."</p>

<p>"Oh," answered George, smiling, "if that's all you
want I can fix you. When do you want to begin?"</p>

<p>"I am ready to start in right neow," was the reply.
"I told the old folks when I left the house last night
that they needn't expect to see me ag'in 'til my name
wuz on the walls an' the sides o' houses in letters
more'n a yard long, an' I'm goin' to do it or die."</p>

<p>"I see you're made out of the right kind of stuff,"
said George, "and I'll give you a first-class chance.
You're ambitious and you're lean&mdash;lean enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
play Falstaff&mdash;and lean and ambitious people always
make their mark. Have you ever heard of the lean
and hungry Cassius?&mdash;I don't mean a depositor at
the door of a busted bank, but the Cassius of 'Julius
Cæsar.' I'll bet you feel just like him now; you look
like him."</p>

<p>The Cahokian candidate for Thespian honors blushed.</p>

<p>"Well," the practical joker went on, "you can begin
work this morning. The minstrels will be here in a
few minutes for rehearsal, and they want a new box
of gags. Go over to Harry Noxon, at the Comique,
and ask him to give you a box of the best gags he's
got. Tell him they're for me."</p>

<p>With a face wreathed in smiles the Cahokian <i>Cassius</i>
stalked off towards the Comique while George went
out and gathered in a few friends to enjoy the joke.
The Cahokian went to the Comique, and Harry Noxon,
understanding what was meant, gave the poor fellow a
box half filled with bricks, and telling him that was all
he had, directed him to go up to Pope's and ask for
Ed. Zimmerman, who would fill the box for him.
Shouldering the heavy load, the Cahokian moved
bravely out towards Pope's, six and one-half blocks
away. He was pretty tired when he got there. Ed.
Zimmerman, in obedience to his request, sent the box
around to the stage-door, where the carpenter removed
the lid and added bricks enough to fill the receptacle.
Nailing the lid on again the stage-struck youth was
once more presented with it. It took a great deal of
exertion for him to get the box to his shoulder, and
when he had it there he staggered along under the load
like a drunken man, to the Opera House seven blocks
away. When he reached the Opera House, McManus
said the Minstrels had changed their mind about using
any new gags, and requested the Cahokian to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
them over to the Olympic. The Cahokian looked at
McManus, then took a woeful and weary look at the
box, and, wiping the perspiration from his high forehead
and thin face, he swung his slouch hat over his
brow and remarked that he was tired.</p>

<p>"I say, Mister," he said, "if that's what a fellow's
got to do to be a actor I'd sooner plow corn er
run a thrashin'-masheen twenty-three hours out'n the
twenty-four. I thought there was more fun in the
business than carryin' around two or three hundred
pounds of iron or somethin' like it, all day in the sun.
I guess I'll throw up my engagement. Good-bye."
And he strode out into the street, while George and
his friends had a laugh that was as hearty as the lungs
that led in the merriment were loud and strong.</p>

<p>There are a few young men and young ladies in this
world who do not take the same view of the stage that
the Cahokian took: they imagine there is a great deal
of fun in being an actor or an actress, and that it does
not require any special effort to arrive at the point
where a person becomes a full-fledged professional. In
this they are just as much mistaken as was the Cahokian,
and sometimes, after they have gone into training
for the profession, they tire of the hard work as readily
almost as the stage-struck young farmer tired of carrying
the box of "gags." There is a general wild
desire among the young people of this country to
make players of themselves. They dream that the
stage is something like a seventh heaven where there is
nothing but music and singing and golden glory forever&mdash;admirers,
wealth, and an uninterrupted good
time generally. They do not know anything about
the long and toilsome hours of work and the comparatively
poor pay that form the portion of all who are
not at the top of the dramatic ladder. They never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
pause to think if they are girls of the temptations into
which they will be thrown, and of the slanders that will
be uttered against their fair names upon the slightest
provocation. All they see or know of theatrical life is
its bright gilded side, the tinsel that looks valuable, the
jewels that are paste, the silks and satins that are not
what they seem, and the beautiful faces and bright smiles
beneath which are wrinkles and toil-laden looks, when
the actress is in her home plying her needle or studying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
the long lengths that belong to her part. It is because
people are so ignorant of the realities of dramatic life
that so many become stage-struck and go around striking
tragic attitudes and rating imaginary scenery in
a rabid rant through Othello's address to the Senate,
or Hamlet's scene with his mother in the latter's
chamber. There are forty thousand young ladies
in this land who want to be Mary Andersons, and as
many more who think they can kick as cutely as Lotta,
while one hundred thousand semi-bald young men imagine
they could out-Hamlet Booth if they had a
chance, or lift the mantle of Forrest from John McCullough
if the latter dared enter the ring with them.
A Louisville newspaper reporter gave a very humorous
description of an epidemic of this kind that prevailed
in Mary Anderson's home city some time ago.
"One half the girls of the city," said the writer,
"are stage-struck!&mdash;stark, staring stage-struck. Hundreds
of residences have been converted into amateur
play-houses, where would-be female stars tear their
hair, rave and split the air with their arms, and stalk
majestically across imaginary stages to the imaginary
music of imaginary orchestras, and amid burst of imaginary
applause and showers of imaginary boquets.
In the dry goods stores young ladies rush up to the
counters with inspiration dropping from their eyes in
great hunks and in hollow tones command the affrightened
clerk <span class="locked">to&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Haste thee, cringing vassal; pr-r-r-r-ro-duce and
br-r-r-r-r-ing into our pr-r-r-r-r-esence thy sixty-five-cent
hose!"</p>

<p>In the ice cream saloons the maidens shove the cooling
cream into their lovely mouths and sweetly murmur
to their <span class="locked">escorts:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Now, by me faith, Orlando, but is't not a nectar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
fit for the gods? Speak, me beloved; is't not a
dainty dish that graces our festal board?"</p>

<p>And practical Orlando <span class="locked">replies:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I bet you."</p>

<p>On the street-car the maiden stalks forward toward
the driver and <span class="locked">howls:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"What, ho, there, charioteer, give me, I pray thee,
diminutive coin for this one dollar bond an' I will upon
the instant requite thee for thy services upon this
journey."</p>

<p>When one of them catches a flea she holds the victim
at arms' length and <span class="locked">roars:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Ha-a-a-a! I have thee at last, vile craven. For
many nights thy visits to me chamber have br-r-r-ought
unrest. Now at la-a-st thou art in me clutches and I
will shower vengeance upon thy thr-rice accursed head.
Die, vile in-gr-rate, and may the seething fires of perdition
engulf thy quivering soul forever-r-r-r!"</p>

<p>Then she opens her fingers a little to get a good
squeeze at him and the flea hops out and goes home
to tell its folks about it. They have got it bad and
none of the old established methods of treatment seem
to avail.</p>

<p>It is the very height of absurdity to see an amateur
company on a stage, and particularly on the stage of a
theatre. In the midst of the most solemn tragedy one
is compelled to laugh at them. If they have on tights
and trunks they try to get their hands into side pockets,
and if they carry swords the weapon gets tangled
in their legs, and ten to one after the blade has left its
scabbard, the wearer will be unable to get it back
again. Then the way they walk upon each other's
heels, and tread upon each other's corns; jostle each
other in the entrances and stick in their lines is enough
to make one of the painted figures in the proscenium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
arch tear itself out of its medalion frame and die from
excessive laughter. More ludicrous even than their
performance is the frantic rush a young amateur makes
for the photograph gallery to have himself preserved
as a courtier, and the equally rapid progress the young
society lady makes in the same direction&mdash;anxious to
have her picture taken no matter whether she plays a
queen, a lady of honor, or a page in tights. She has
no hesitancy in displaying her awkward limbs in a
picture, although she would be ashamed to show her
ankle in the parlor.</p>

<p>Sometimes, instead of being made the subject of a
practical joke on the street, as was the Cahokian of
whom I told the story at the opening of this chapter,
the joke is carried even farther&mdash;the aspirant being
taken to the stage to give a sample of his work. Occasionally
the show is given to the people of the theatre
only, and the victim is quietly let through a trap,
or guyed unmercifully, until he is glad of an opportunity
to make his escape. I was present on an
occasion when an Illinoisan who had just graduated
from college was allowed to go on the stage during a
matinee performance, when the house was light, to
speak his piece. He chose, of course, the selection he
had inflicted on the suffering audience that attended
the Illinois college graduating exercises. It was "The
Warrior Bowed his Crested Head," a very dramatic
recitation and a difficult one even for a good reader.
The debutant was about eighteen years of age, tall, and
manly looking. He came forward trembling, and did
not attempt to proceed further than about twelve feet
from the entrance,&mdash;making a school-boy bow he
began. The audience wondered at the innocence
and awkwardness of the entertainer who did not
appear in the programme, but all soon understood the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>affair. The debutant had not reached the second line
of the second verse, when bang came a pistol shot
from the side of the stage. The speaker ducked his
head, trembled a little more than before, but went on.
Bang went another pistol shot, and again the speaker
acknowledged receipt of a shock by twitching his head
and knocking his knees together. Still he kept on reciting.
Sheet-iron thunder rattled through the place,
horns were blown, drums beaten, horse-rattles kept in
motion and for more than half an hour pistol shots and
flashes of fire kept coming from both sides of the stage.
Still he spoke on, making gestures, twitching his limbs,
and ducking his head until the last line was reached,&mdash;something
about the hero's weapons shining no more
among the spears of Spain,&mdash;when he bowed and retired
hardly able to walk. He was an exception,
however, to the general rule that stage-struck people
are easily frightened out of their wits, under such circumstances,
and displayed such perseverance that he
was complimented by the audience that had scarcely
heard a word of what he had said&mdash;a loud burst of
applause following his exit, which was continued until
he came forward again and by a bow acknowledged
their kindness. He must have been a brave fellow, for
next day he was around at the manager's office asking
for an engagement.</p>

<p>Managers are sometimes very cruel in their treatment
of young people who are anxious to adopt the stage. I
saw a newspaper item stating that at the Buckingham,
a variety show in Louisville, a drop curtain was
painted with the huge letters "N.&nbsp;G.," standing for
"no good," and the manager ordered that this verdict
be lowered in front of every performer who failed to
show a fair degree of merit. It happened that the first
to deserve this crushing verdict was a remarkably pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
girl, and the audience sympathized with her. She had
given an execrable dance, and was in the midst of a
woeful recitation, when the "N.&nbsp;G." curtain was lowered.
The audience demanded her reappearance and
did not permit anybody else to perform until the police
had arrested the more gallant and noisy among
them.</p>

<p>Amateurs who have any money to mingle with their
desire to go on the stage find ready takers. I could
name several gentlemen who are now alleged professionals,
with talents that are not even mediocre, who
are tolerated in first-class company only because they
pay for the privilege. One way a moneyed, stage-struck
person has of getting before the public is to
rent a theatre, and hire a company for a night or a
week or a month, as the case may be. Society swells
generally do this kind of thing, and they never succeed.
Marie Dixon was, under another name, a fairly
well-to-do, well connected and popular lady of Memphis,
Tennessee. She was old enough to have a married
son, but did not appear to be more than thirty-six
years. Her family had been very wealthy before the
war, but that event swept away their possessions, as
it swept away the possessions of many others. She
was educated and accomplished, but was stage-struck.
She had appeared at several amateur concert entertainments
in Memphis, and the local papers having
complimented her, and her friends having remarked
that she was intended for an actress, she boldly, but
foolishly, resolved to become one. She made up her
mind to rival Mary Anderson, and to overshadow the
memory of Ristori and all the great queens of the stage
that have made a place for themselves in dramatic
history. She paid $2,000 for the use of a St. Louis
theatre for six nights; she hired a very bad company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
at, to them, very extravagant salaries; she bought a
wardrobe larger and in some respects richer than that
of any established star; then she came to St. Louis
with her aged father, whose hopes and money were
staked upon her; they put up at the Lindell Hotel,
and having left Memphis amid a flourish of trumpets,
they fondly expected a wilder flourish when they
returned. Miss Dixon appeared before the St. Louis
public for six nights, and was a failure. She was no
actress. She was ashamed to return to Memphis, and
at this writing is still absent from there. The father
went home, and, I hear, died of a broken heart. Disappointed
friends at first pitied, then laughed at this
accomplished lady, whose only fault seems to be that
she was one of the grand army of the stage-struck.</p>

<p>Miss Helen M. Lewis, a Charleston, South Carolina,
heiress, who was anxious to become a Sarah
Bernhardt or a Siddons, was taken in recently by an
advertisement in a New York paper. The advertisement
stated that a lady with a little capital was wanted
to head a first-class dramatic combination, and that
she might call at No. 602 Sixth Avenue, New York.
Miss Lewis, who was without any training, answered
the advertisement, and was told that $1,000 would be
required to obtain the position, which was leading
lady in the "Daniel Rochat" Combination, which was
to begin its tour, by opening at the Boston Theatre.
The negotiations were carried on with Maurice A.
Schwab and Robert J. Rummel, who received $700
from Miss Lewis, and furnished her with an alleged instructor
in the dramatic art. In order to be near the
theatre Miss Lewis took rooms at the Revere House,
Boston, where Schwab and Rummel also established
themselves, and proceeded to study her part after engaging
an alleged instructor recommended by Schwab.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
After two or three weeks' standing off by the swindlers,
who made constant demands on her for money
for her wardrobe and other things, she chanced to call
at the Boston Theatre to hear how the rehearsals of
"Daniel Rochat" were progressing. She was told
that there were no rehearsals in progress and learned
that she had been swindled. Schwab and Hummel
fled, leaving her to pay her hotel bill, but she had them
arrested in New York, and both on trial were, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
think, convicted and sent to the penitentiary, where
plenty more managers of their stripe should be.</p>

<p>Managers of what are known as "snap" companies
are just as bad as Schwab and Rummel. They are
glad to find some young lady or gentleman of means
with lots of ready cash, and they do not hesitate to
make victims even of professional people. The snap
manager has no money of his own. He sits around a
theatrical printing office all day, and pretends to be
running a circuit of several towns. He watches his
opportunity until a company comes along which he
thinks he can take over to his villages. By false
representations he manages to run up a big bill with the
printer and to borrow money from the company, who
go as far on his circuit as their means will permit,
when the snap manager deserts them, leaving them to
walk, or beg, or borrow their way home as best they
can. Marie Prescott, who supported Salvini during
his last American tour, and who is an actress of merit,
was caught in the clutches of one of these managers at
one time and was put in a pitiable plight. Other actresses
of good reputation have accepted engagements
from strange managers only to find themselves members
of fly-by-night combinations, giving their services
without even the show of a probability of ever
receiving any salary.</p>

<p>Even so exalted a gentleman and eminent an impresario
as Col. Mapleson is alleged to have brought a
young girl from France promising he would make a
fortune for her. The girl's father and mother accompanied
her, and when the gallant colonel of Italian
troupes failed to keep his contract with the sweet
singer, the father became enraged and wanted to fight
a duel with the military impresario. The family went
back to France almost penniless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
The worst class of managers in the world are those
who take advantage of the ambition of young girls to
effect their ruin. In some of the variety theatres managers
pay salaries to young ladies or introduce them
to the stage for none other than a base and iniquitous
purpose. Frightful stories of this kind have been told,
and the success real managers have met with in this
direction has caused numerous pretenders to arise, and
has made the theatrical profession a bait to secure innocent
girls for Western and Southern bawdy-houses,
concert dives, and low dancing-halls. I read the following
advertisement in the <i>Globe-Democrat</i> one
<span class="locked">morning:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Personal</span>&mdash;Wanted, three or four young ladies to join a travelling
company. Address Manager, this office.</p></blockquote>

<p>I knew that reputable theatrical managers did not
advertise in this style&mdash;indeed, they need not advertise
at all, for there is always plenty of talent in the
market&mdash;and came to the conclusion that the
"Personal" was a veil to hide some piece of dirty
work. Therefore I sat down, and, in varying feminine
hands, wrote letters to the manager, asking for an
opening. Two letters, with their corresponding answers,
are here selected as specimens of the remainder,
answers to all having been received. One of the applications
ran as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

<span class="smcap">St. Louis</span>, February 6, 1878.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Manager</span>: I want to adopt the stage; have appeared
as an amateur, and will join you if I can learn.
I am seventeen, a blonde, small, and my friends say I
look well on the stage. I sing and perform on the guitar.
I have a friend&mdash;a very pretty brunette&mdash;who is very
anxious to go with me, but she has never acted. She is
same age. Please let me know where I can see you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
if you have not already employed enough; but I must
be particular, as my mother does not want me to go
away. Address</p>

</p>

<p>I will call at general delivery and get it.</p></blockquote>

<p>The other was written in this strain and in these
<span class="locked">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

<span class="smcap">St. Louis</span>, February 6, 1877.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I saw your advertisement in this morning's
<i>Globe-Democrat</i>, asking for three or four young
ladies to join a travelling theatrical company, and as I
am desirous of going on the stage, and am of good
form and pretty fair appearance, and have a pretty
good voice, I would wish to join your company. I
have never appeared on any regular stage, but made
several amateur appearances, which were pronounced
very successful. I have an ambition for the stage,
and think I would succeed. I am seventeen years of
age, and medium height, with black hair and dark
eyes, and am a tasty dresser. I hope you will not
pass over my application, but will receive it favorably.

<p>P.&nbsp;S.&mdash;Address your reply to me to the post-office.</p></blockquote>

<p>These and the others were all calculated to make the
"manager" feel that he had captured a whole shoal of
gudgeons. He would certainly reply to such unsophisticated
notes as these, and he did. The letters were
placed in the newspaper office box on Wednesday afternoon,
and bright and early on Thursday morning, I
went around to the post-office, presented my string of
names, and met with no little opposition from the gentlemanly
delivery clerk, at first, who naturally did not
like to give an armful of mail for females to one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
was not a female. The situation was explained, however,
and a half dozen rose-tinted envelopes, all properly
backed and stamped, and each containing an
epistle, was the result. They were opened one after
another, and the rose-tinted and perfumed pages of
each told, in a bold running hand exactly the same
story&mdash;"pass the corner of Eighth and Locust Streets,"
at hours varying from noon to sundown on Thursday
afternoon. It was just what had been expected. Ettie
Holan, the petite blonde, who could play the guitar,
was answered as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>And Lizzie Hilger, with nothing to recommend her
but a voice and figure that she had recommended herself,
was encouraged in her ambitious aspirations in the
following <span class="locked">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Here then was the "manager's" little game. Of
course Harry Russell was not the man's name at all,
and of course he had no office to which either Miss
Ettie Holan or Miss Lizzie Hilger, or any of the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
other girls who had applied for positions through me,
"might object to coming," and of course he had nothing
to do with strengthening any company's Boston
or Chicago engagements. It was evident now, if not
before, that the advertisement was a snare to trap the
unwary and to pull the wool over the eyes of the innocent
and unsuspecting, and I made up my mind to pay
a visit to the locality named in the above letters.</p>

<p>A visit was paid, after dinner, to the proposed place
of meeting. On the way up I met a detective friend,
to whom my business was disclosed. The detective
said he would go along and "spot" the fellow for
future reference, and he did. Handsome Harry was
found at his post, gazing up and down and across the
street. He was standing in front of a saloon, on the
corner, and a friend was hard by, who was to witness
the success of the little game. Now and then a young
lady passed to or from her home, and every time she
came within sight "Manager" Harry began to prepare
himself for the "mash." The coat front was readjusted,
the shirt collar straightened up, the hat lifted
from the head and the fingers run through the hair,
and, as a last and finishing touch, the ends of his dainty
moustache were fingered and carefully set away from his
lips with a silk handkerchief. But here came the
young lady. How he stared her in the face as she came
towards him, ogled her when near by, and cast a disconsolate
and disappointed look after her as she passed.
Then he went back to communicate to his friend that
she was probably "not the one," or that "maybe she
weakened," and again took his stand to watch the next
comer. This little business was gone through with as
many times as there were young ladies who passed. At
last it was evident to the two persons who had their eyes
on Harry that he was beginning to weaken, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
about to leave the place for a time at least. Under
these circumstances there was only one thing to do&mdash;to
go over and have a talk with him about the show
business and make further engagements for the young
ladies who were so anxious to blossom forth on the
stage. The detective walked up to the man who was
presumably Harry Russell:</p>

<p>"Do you know of a man named Harry Russell stopping
about here?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>Harry was with his friend now, and both became almost
livid in the face and were evidently taken back
by the inquiry.</p>

<p>"N-no; w-what is he?" stammered out Harry.</p>

<p>"I believe he's manager of a theatrical company."</p>

<p>"Harry" had somewhat regained his mental equilibrium
by this time, and answered positively: "Don't
know him; never heard of him."</p>

<p>"Have you seen any man around in the past half
hour? Russell made an engagement to meet me
here."</p>

<p>"I haven't been here but about ten minutes," and
away "Harry" and his friend sailed.</p>

<p>The detective and myself had been watching
the pseudo manager for over two hours from a room
across the street, and, of course, knew there was no
truth in the measure he placed upon the time he was
watching and waiting for victims that never came.
He was not a theatrical man, but some dirty scamp.</p>

<p>Some time ago an advertisement of the same character
as the "Personal" quoted above, appeared in
the Chicago papers, and many young ladies, anxious
to adopt the stage as a profession, applied for positions.
They obtained admission to the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quasi</i> manager,
who, when no resistance was made by the applicants,
shipped them to Texas and other Southern points,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
where they found themselves perhaps penniless in the
midst of a life of uncertainties, into which they had
been duped and to which they had been sold. Many
of these had been, and would still be, respectable
young girls and ornaments to their respective home
circles, were it not for the serpent with the fascinating
eyes that peeped out at them from under the three or
four lines in the advertising columns of that Chicago
paper. Discoveries of the same kind were made in
several cities of the East, and it is dreadful to contemplate
the havoc which must have been wrought by this
means, for surely many of the hundreds of really good
girls, who are always sure to answer such an advertisement
in the innocent belief that it may be the means
of making Neilsons, Cushmans, Morrises or some other
equally firmamentary individual in the galaxy of the
stage of them, and who refused to be debauched, were
sorely disappointed in the result of their apparent good
fortune in obtaining the recognition of the "manager."</p>

<p>The following letter from a band of stage-struck
young men of color is an extraordinary document, and
may be taken as a sample of the letters received every
day by theatrical <span class="locked">managers:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<span class="subhead">THE REHEARSAL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When the seeker after histrionic honors has at last
crossed the threshold of the stage, he or she will find
it entirely different from the glitter and glory with
which the imagination had clothed things theatrical.
The first revelation made to new-comers in the profession
is the rehearsal. This generally begins about
ten <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> and ends about two <span class="smcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> In the old days of
stock companies, performers had more laborious work to
perform than men who carry railroad iron out of, or into,
steamboats. Often there were new plays every night,
which meant new parts to be memorized, and rehearsals
every day. Leaving the theatre at eleven <span class="smcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>,
about the usual hour of closing a performance at that
time, the actor took his part with him, and instead of
going to his bed, was obliged to sit up and study his
lines&mdash;no matter how many lengths there were.
Torn and worn out with his night's work on the stage,
and the mental toil that followed, it was often already
morning when the actor sought his couch. He
was then obliged to be up in a few hours and at the
theatre at ten. If he absented himself there was a fine
that would materially reduce his already low salary.
Where was the room for enjoyment for the actor or
actress in those days? There was little opportunity
given to anybody at all employed upon the stage to be
of dissolute habits or to indulge in any of the excesses
that pulpit-pounders and their intolerant and intolerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
followers generally charged against the profession.
These super-moral individuals could not make
a distinction between the stage of the days of Mrs.
Bracegirdle and Mistress Woffington, of Mrs. Jordan
and Mrs. Robinson, when filth and licentiousness prevailed
because the public found no fault with it, and
the same things were prevalent in ranks of the very
best society. Now that we have travelling combinations,
and that one part will last a man or woman who
pays attention to business for a year or more, the profession
is not so heavily taxed; still there is plenty of
work, and there is little, if any, time to devote to any
of the pleasures or excesses that prurient piety points
out as the portion of players. But this is moralizing.
Let us get back to the rehearsal. Less than ten years
ago a rehearsal might be found going on in any theatre
in the country between the hours of ten <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> and
two <span class="smcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> Now it is a rare thing to find a rehearsal except
on Monday, and in the few cities where Sunday-night
performances are given this day may be set
apart, when the opening or first performance is on the
same night. As travelling goes now, a company
reaches a town either the night before, or the morning
of the day for their initial entertainment. No matter
what the time of arrival&mdash;unless it be, as often happens,
that the company gets off the train and to the
theatre fifteen minutes before the curtain is to go up&mdash;every
member of the company will be expected at the
theatre in the morning for rehearsal, not so much to
go through their parts as to familiarize themselves
with the entrances and exits and the general arrangement
of the house. The stage manager is there and
the orchestra is in its place. If it is comic opera there
is a rehearsal of the music, and if it is one of the
musico-farcical or burlesque pieces that were epidemic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
during the past two seasons, the play will be rehearsed
that the musicians may come in with their flare up at
the proper time.</p>

<p>A rehearsal is calculated to take all the starch out of
the ambition of a neophyte, and to drench his hopes in
a sorrowful manner. The stage bereft of its flood of
light, of its gorgeous color and wealth of splendor, is
the darkest, dreariest, and most commonplace region
in the world. The buzz of saw and the clatter of
hammer are heard in all directions, while men in aprons,
overalls, and greasy caps are making the saw-and-hammer
noises, and others even less romantic are dragging
about scenery or boxes; gas men are at work on the
foot-lights, and there is noise and confusion enough to
set a whole villagefull of sybarites crazy. Down in
front a group of ladies and gentlemen are moving
about and talking. These are the players&mdash;the people
we saw the night before in rich attire, with glowing
jewels and surrounded with all the magnificence,
wealth could bestow or royalty command. Now, the
king's crown is a black slouch hat and the royal robes
are a dark sack coat and vest, light trousers, and white
shirt with picadilly collar. The queen has a last-year
bonnet on her head and a water-proof cloak envelopes
her form. The other actors are also in every-day dress,
some showing that their owners patronize first-class
tailors and others that they have been handed down
from the shelves of cheap ready-made clothing houses.
The stage manager is pushing everybody around, and
the actors and actresses are talking at one another in
lines. Some have books of the play, for they are rehearsing,
and all rattle over their lines as if running a
race with a locomotive that is drawing Vanderbilt's
special car over the road at its topmost speed. It is
impossible to understand what they are saying, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
the on-looker would be willing to wager a $10 gold
piece against a silver dime with a hole in it that the
performers do not hear or understand each other.
But a California journalist has written a very truthful
and funny account of a rehearsal he attended in San
Francisco. Olive Logan has it in her book, but it is
so good I will make use of it again. Here it <span class="locked">is:&mdash;</span></p>

  <img src="images/i_230.jpg" width="327" height="381" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">AGNES BOOTH.</div></div>

<p>You may get as perfect an idea of a play by seeing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
rehearsed as you would of Shakespeare from hearing it
read in Hindustani. The first act consists in an exhibition
of great irritability and impatience by the stage
manager at the non-appearance of certain members
of the troupe. At what theatre? Oh, never mind
what theatre. We will take liberties and mix them
<span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Stage Manager (calling to some one at the front entrance):
"Send those people in."</p>

<p>The people are finally hunted up one by one and go
rushing down the passage and on to the stage like human
whirlwinds.</p>

<p>Leading Lady (reading): "My chains a-a-a-a-a
rivet me um-um-um (carpenters burst out in a tremendous
fit of hammering) this man."</p>

<p>Star: "But I implore&mdash;buz-buz-buz&mdash;<i>never</i>&mdash;um-um"
(great sawing of boards somewhere).</p>

<p>Rehearsal reading, mind you, consists in the occasional
distinct utterance of a word, sandwiched in between
large quantities of a strange, monotonous sound,
something between a drawl and a buz, the last two or
three words of the part being brought out with an
emphatic jerk.</p>

<p>Here Th&mdash;&mdash;n rushes from the <span class="locked">rear:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Now my revenge."</p>

<p>Star (giving directions): "No, you Mrs. H&mdash;s&mdash;n,
stand there, and then when I approach you, Mr.
B&mdash;r&mdash;y, step a little to the left; then the soldiers
pitch into the villagers and the villagers into the soldiers,
and I shoot you and escape into the mountains."</p>

<p>Stage Manager (who thinks differently): "Allow
me to suggest, Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;s, that"&mdash;(here the hammering
and sawing burst out all over the stage and
drown everything).</p>

<p>This matter is finally settled. The decision of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
oldest member of the troupe having been appealed to,
is adopted. Then Mr. Mc&mdash;&mdash;h is missing. The
manager bawls "Mc&mdash;&mdash;h!" Everybody bawls,
"Mc&mdash;&mdash;h!" "Gimlet! Gimlet!" This is the
playful rehearsal appellation for <i>Hamlet</i>. Gimlet is at
length captured and goes rushing like a locomotive
down the passage.</p>

<p>Stage Manager: "Now, ladies and gentlemen. All
on!"</p>

<p>They tumble up the stage steps and gather in groups.
H&mdash;l&mdash;n fences with everybody. Miss H&mdash;w&mdash;n executes
an imperfect <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pas seul</i>.</p>

<p>Leading Lady: "I-a-a-a-a love-um-um-um&mdash;and-a-a-a
another&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss H&mdash;l&mdash;y, Miss M&mdash;d&mdash;e, or any other woman:
"This engage-a-a-a my son's um-um Bank Exchange."</p>

<p>A&mdash;d&mdash;n raises his hands and eyes to heaven, saying:
"Great father! he's drunk!"</p>

<p>Leading Lady (very energetically): "Go not, dearest
Hawes! The Gorhamites are a-a-a-um-um devour
thee."</p>

<p>Mrs. S&mdash;n&mdash;s: "How! What!!"</p>

<p>Mrs. J&mdash;&mdash;h: "Are those peasantry up there?"</p>

<p>Boy comes up to the stage and addresses the manager
through his nose: "Mr. G., I can't find him anywhere."</p>

<p>H&mdash;&mdash;y J&mdash;&mdash;n: "For as much as I"&mdash;(terrible
hammering).</p>

<p>Nasal boy: "Mr. G., I can't find him anywhere."</p>

<p>L&mdash;c&mdash;h: "Stop my paper!"</p>

<p>Manager: "Mr. L., that must be brought out very
strong; thus, <i>Stop my paper!</i>"</p>

<p>L&mdash;c&mdash;h (bringing it out with an emphasis which
raises the roof off the theatre): "<span class="smcap">Stop my paper!</span>"</p>

<p>The leading lady hero goes through the motion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
fainting and falls against the star, who is partly unbalanced
by her weight and momentum. The star then
rushes distractedly about, arranging the supernumeraries
to his liking. Ed&mdash;s and B&mdash;y walk abstractedly
to and fro. S&mdash;n&mdash;r dances to a lady near the
wings. These impromptu dances seem to be a favorite
pastime on the undressed stage.</p>

<p>Second Lady: "Positively a-a-a- Tom Fitch um-um
amusing a-aitch a-aitch a-aitch!"</p>

<p>It puzzled me for a long time to find out what was
meant by this repetition of a-aitch. It is simply
the reading of laughter. A-aitch is where "the
laugh comes in." The genuine pearls of laughter are
reserved for the regular performance. Actresses cannot
afford to cachinate during the tediousness and
drudgery of rehearsal. Usually they feel like crying.</p>

<p>Stage Manager: "We must rehearse this last act
over again."</p>

<p>Everybody at this announcement looks broadswords
and daggers. There are some pretty pouts from the
ladies, and some deep but energetic profanity from the
gentlemen.</p>

  <div class="caption">"NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ALL TOGETHER."</div></div>

<p>The California journalist has just about done justice
to the subject. I have attended rehearsals when it
was utterly impossible to comprehend whether they
were reading Revelations or going through Mother
Goose's melodies. Drilling the chorus for opera is
attained by the same trials and tribulations as rehearsals
for dramatic representations. The leader grows
furious at the surrounding noise, and the distractions
that members of the chorus give themselves up to. It
is a bad thing to get them together at first and harder
still to keep them together afterwards. When the
leader with an atmosphere of the kindest humor surrounding
his smooth head holds his baton aloft imagining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
that everything is all right, says: "Now, ladies and
gentlemen, all together," he gracefully lowers his arm,
but suddenly arises in an angry mood, for they are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
all together. About one-half the throng begin, and
the other half loiter behind to drop in at intervals.
And so it goes from act to act until the opera is finished.
The singers are in street dress and the shabbiest
of garments brush against the most stylish. In
rehearsing grand opera only one act is taken at a time,
and the scenes presented, with the mellifluous Italian
and the sweet-scented garlic floating around the stage,
are picturesque to the eye, charming to the ear, and
simply entrancing to the nose. The principals rehearse
sitting.</p>

  <div class="caption">TRAINING BALLET DANCERS.</div></div>

<p>Ballet dancers have as hard work, if not harder than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
any other class in the profession. They must rehearse
or practice daily, and for hours and hours at a time.
The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maitre</i> is there with cane and eye-glass, with velvet
coat and lavender trousers, to show them the motions,
and line after line the strength and limberness of the
limbs of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps de ballet</i> are tested. From the
premiere who sits with sealskin sack over her stage
costume with her pet dog by her side down to the
latest acquisition to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maitre's</i> (the ballet master's)
corps, all must be on hand to rehearse with or without
music. In the latter instance the steps are slowly but
carefully gone through. Not only is there a day
rehearsal, but there is private individual rehearsal of
the steps at night previous to going on the stage; for
there is much grace in a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps de ballet</i>, and no girl in
love with her art wishes to be considered awkward or
in the rear; hence the emulation that exists, and the
private rehearsals in the dressing-room. Many of these
ballet dancers live poor lives, getting salaries which
after buying their stage dresses leaves them little for the
cupboard and very little to waste upon street costumes.
Some are frail, and have admirers whose purse-strings
they pull wide open, and are therefore able to rustle
around in silks and sport rich golden and jewelled ornaments,
while the honest girls must sup at home on
crusts and share the opprobrium their shamless companions
bring on the entire class. Ballet girls everywhere
have a throng of giddy, dissipating male followers,
and those who resist the temptations thrown in
their way are deserving praise rather than condemnation.</p>

  <div class="caption">NATIONAL DANCES.</div></div>

<p>Just as the Spanish have their Mauzai, the Hindoos
their Nautch girls, the Japanese that remarkable
dance travellers have written so frequently and so much
about, and each country its own particular sway or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>whirl, so this country seems to have taken kindly to
the ballet. When a ballet dancer&mdash;one of the famous
dancers of the beginning of the century&mdash;presented
herself for the first time to an Albany, New York,
audience, the ladies rushed from the stage and there
was almost a panic. But it did not take long to
accustom the Albanians to the undraped drama, and
they are as fond of it now as any of the rest of the not
over-scrupulous people of the country. Not so many
years ago, there was a ballet every night in the first-class
variety theatres; now there are few, except in
the East, that have this feature, and for this reason&mdash;the
abandonment of it in the West and South&mdash;the
people who draw conclusions from everything they see
and hear cry out that the ballet is dying out. This is
not so. The ballet has been dropped from the list of
attractions in the West, because the managers thought
it too costly an institution for them to carry and not
because the people did not want it. Some of the best
paying theatrical investments of the day are based
upon the fascinating and drawing qualities of a displayed
female limb. Burlesque with its blonde attributes
kept the country in a rage for many years, and
the reason why it is so rare now is that comic opera
and the minor musical attractions of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quasi</i> legitimate
stage have usurped its principal feature&mdash;the leg
show&mdash;and under the cover of art get the patronage
of people who would shun burlesques, and at the same
time supply the demand of about three-fourths of the
male persuasion who are as fond of as much anatomy
in pink tights as the law will allow them. If any one
thinks the ballet is on the decay just let him wait
until such an attraction is announced in his neighborhood
and then stand back and count as the bald-headed
brigade goes to the front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
And for those who take any interest in the ballet, or
care to hear anything about the women who have
become famous as dancers, the following bit of history
which I found in Gleason's <i>Pictoral</i> for 1854 will
be very agreeable reading: "A recent performance at
her majesty's theatre in London has been signalized by
an event unparalleled in theatrical annals, and one
which, some two score years hence, may be handed
down to a new generation by garrulous septuagenarians
as one of the most brilliant reminiscences of days
gone by. The appearance of four such dancers as
Taglioni, Cerito, Carlotta Grisi and Lucile Grahn, on
the same boards and in the same <i>pas</i>, is truly what
the French would call "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">une solemnite theatrale</i>," and
such a one as none of those who beheld it are likely to
witness again. It was therefore as much a matter of
curiosity as of interest, to hurry to the theatre to
witness this spectacle; but every other feeling was
merged in admiration when the four great dancers
commenced the series of picturesque groupings with
which this performance opens. Perhaps a scene was
never witnessed more perfect in all its details. The
greatest of painters, in his loftiest flights, could hardly
have conceived, and certainly never executed, a group
more faultless and more replete with grace and poetry
than that formed by these four danseuses. Taglioni
in the midst, her head thrown backwards, apparently
reclining in the arms of her sister nymphs. Could
such a combination have taken place in the ancient
palmy days of art, the pencil of the painter and the
pen of the poet would have alike been employed to
perpetuate its remembrance. No description can
render the exquisite, and almost ethereal grace of
movement and attitude of these great dancers, and
those who have witnessed the scene, may boast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
having once, at least, seen the perfection of the art of
dancing so little understood. There was no affectation,
no apparent exertion or struggle for effect on the part
of these gifted artistes; and though they displayed their
utmost resources, there was a simplicity and ease, the
absence of which would have completely broken the
spell they threw around the scene. Of the details of
this performance it is difficult to speak. In the solo
steps executed by each danseuse, each in turn seemed
to claim pre-eminence. Where every one in her own
style is perfect, peculiar individual taste alone may
balance in favor of one or the other, but the award of
public applause must be equally bestowed; and the
<i>penchant</i> for the peculiar style, and the admiration for
the dignity, the repose and the exquisite grace which
characterize Taglioni, and the dancer who has so brilliantly
followed the same track (Lucile Grahn), did
not prevent the warm appreciation of the charming
archness and twinkling steps of Carlotta Grisi, or the
wonderful flying leaps and revolving bounds of Cerito.
Though each displayed her utmost powers, the emulation
of the fair dancers was unaccompanied by envy.
Every time a shower of boquets descended on the
conclusion of a solo <i>pas</i> of one or the other of the fair
<i>ballerine</i>, her sister dancers came forward to assist her
in collecting them. The applause was universal and
equally distributed. This, however, did not take from
the excitement of the scene. The house, crowded to
the roof, presented a concourse of the most eager faces,
never diverted, for a moment, from the performance;
and the extraordinary tumult of enthusiastic applause,
joined to the delightful effect of the spectacle presented,
imparted to the whole scene an interest and
excitement that can hardly be imagined by those not
present."</p>

<span class="subhead">CANDIDATES FOR SHORT CLOTHES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>About a week before the date of the opening of a
spectacular play at any metropolitan theatre an advertisement
reading something like this appears in the
want columns of the daily <span class="locked">papers:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Wanted</span>&mdash;Three hundred girls for the ballet in "The Blue
Huntsman," at Bishop's Theatre. Call at stage-door at
ten <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> Monday.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this simple advertisement the theatrical instinct
which prompts the press agent to exaggerate facts concerning
his attraction is very beautifully displayed.
The number of girls wanted is probably not in excess
of fifty; still the local manager does not care to waste
money upon this little advertisement without getting
an advertisement for his show out of it. Monday
morning brings a number of applicants&mdash;not as large
a number as such an advertisement would have
attracted in former years, but still enough to meet the
demands of the ballet master, who has come on ahead
of his troupe to select the girls and give them a little
training, just sufficient training to tone down the rough
edges of their awkwardness and to drill them in the
marches in which they will be expected to participate.
The girls, as they come in singly or in pairs&mdash;shyly
and coyly approaching the stage-door, but taking
courage at the sight of the others who are there before
them&mdash;are told to come around again in the afternoon,
or perhaps the following morning to meet the ballet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
There doesn't seem to be any particular choice in getting
up a ballet of this kind. A round-shouldered,
broad-waisted, squint-eyed, red-headed girl has her
name entered on the stage manager's book as readily
as the charming little blonde who looks as if she belonged
to the upper walks of life, and appears many
degrees more accomplished, graceful, and intelligent
than the strabismal, carroty-headed creature who has
preceded her. When all have been registered, up to
the requisite number, some of the astonished and delighted
candidates, after having learned that they will
receive $4 or $6, or, maybe, $8, for the week's services,
lose themselves in the intricacies of the scenery
and wonder at the beauties of the new world in which
they find themselves. Their next visit brings them
into the presence of the ballet master, who regards
them physically, scrutinizing each as the name is
called, and seldom rejecting any not absolutely deformed
who appear before him. They are sent to the
costumer's and their work begins at once. All they
are required to do is to run up and down or around the
stage in drills and marches, or to group themselves in
heart-rending tableaux at intervals during the dance.
The best&mdash;that is, the girls who are quick to perceive
and swift to accomplish the commands of the master,
are selected for leaders and for the principal work in
this subordinate branch of the spectacle. Day after
day they are drilled until the night of the first performance
arrives, when, often in tights that do not fit
them, in costumes that are wrinkled and dirty, they
flash in all their awkwardness and gloominess upon the
scene, to be laughed at, and to detract from instead of
adding to the beauty of the spectacle.</p>

<p>A newspaper writer of experience in this line says:
Few of those who observe and admire the graceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
attitudes, easy movements, and picturesque evolutions
of the well-trained chorus or ballet in an opera have
any adequate conception of the amount of practice and
hard work necessary for the stage of perfection arrived
at. A number of years ago, when ballet girls were in
greater demand than at present, an advertisement inserted
in New York papers or those of any other large
city for material to fill up the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps de ballet</i> would
bring in applicants by dozens, and sometimes even by
hundreds. The same is true in a less degree to-day,
but at that time the wages paid to working girls were
far more meagre than at the present time, and the few
dollars per week to be obtained in the theatre was a
princely sum by comparison, and, though the engagement
be but a few weeks, the opportunity was gladly
accepted.</p>

<p>The great majority of these applicants come from
the lower working class, who are induced by pecuniary
motives alone to exhibit themselves. They show in
their faces and forms the traces of hard work and poor
living, and an expert master of the ballet has need of
all his skill to train them and dispose them on the stage
so that their natural disadvantages of form may be
kept as much as possible from public view. Now and
then, however, there is a case where the glamour of
the stage has so fascinated girls in better circumstances
that they are ready to begin at any round of the ladder
in a profession that seems so entirely imbued
with roseate tints. It is the exception, and not the
rule, for these to persevere; for, when brought face to
face with the stern realities of the case, their ardor is
dampened, the world seems hollow, "their dolls are
stuffed with sawdust," and they are prepared to cry
out <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vanitas vanitatum</i>, and enjoy the rest of their
stage experiences from the other side of the foot-lights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
These girls vary somewhat in age, but the majority
of them are not above twenty, as a general rule. In
making an application, they present themselves first to
the stage manager. He takes note of their age, size,
appearance and general contour of figure, and if he be
favorably impressed sends them to the costumer. He,
in his turn, hands them over to the women in his employ.
There they are compelled to strip and undergo
a complete examination of their limbs and form, and
on the physical examination depends their acceptance
or rejection.</p>

<p>In companies where the ballet girls are simply female
supernumeraries and do nothing but march about while
the danseuse and coryphees engage the attention of
the audience, any extended amount of training is not
necessary. Care is only taken to obtain girls of ordinarily
fair physique and teach them to march correctly
with the music. But even this is no small task.</p>

<p>These girls are naturally fitted for anything but this
business, and it is ludicrous to observe the positions
they assume and the gait they adopt. Impressed with
the idea that they must act and walk differently from
their usual custom, they twist their bodies and stalk
about in a manner that is beyond description. These
improvised ballets generally present an exhibition of
stiffness and awkwardness at the first public appearance;
but that is not to be compared with the ungainly
antics of a first rehearsal. In cases where greater
pains are taken, and where the ballet girls go through
many intricate evolutions, the rehearsals are continued
daily, when possible, for a period of six or eight weeks,
and some idea of the trials of a ballet master may be
gathered from the contrast of the first rehearsal and
the first performance.</p>

<p>A gentleman of long experience in theatrical matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
says in a talk with an interviewer: "Well, I
should think I ought to know something about ballet
girls. Why, when I used to be at the Old Comique
they were as plentiful as supers and used to appear as
peasant girls in the regular drama.</p>

  <div class="caption">DRILLING FOR THE CHORUS.</div></div>

<p>"The rehearsals would be frightfully confusing to
an outsider. During the last rehearsal, before a piece
of this kind is put on, the stage looks like a perfect
pandemonium. The chorus is being put through its
final drill on
one side, the
actors are
practising
their entrances,
exits,
and cues
on the other;
behind, the
scene painter
and his assistants are daubing away, and the trap man
and gas man are both working away in their line."</p>

<p>"What kind of girls were they for the most part?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they came out of factories and all that; they
could make from $6 to $8 a week on the stage, a good
deal better than they could do at their old business.
We used to have such a lot of applicants then we could
pick out a pretty good crowd. Some of them were
very nice, respectable girls, but the associations ruined
most of them. A good many of them were rather fly
when they first came in, and besides being crooked
would put on any amount of lug among their companions
outside. After playing in the ballet two or three
weeks for $6 or $7 a week, they would go around and
say that they were actresses, playing an engagement
at the Opera House, but they didn't know exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
how long they should stay there. I wouldn't be at all
surprised if they talked about starring it in another
season; that's what all these fly-by-nights at the
theatres do now. Why, do you know I have had people
come to me and ask what part Miss So-and-So was
taking, and on looking into the matter I would find
that she was a ballet girl."</p>

<p>"Can't you tell me of some cases of girls who have
a little romance about their history?"</p>

<p>"Well, possibly, but to one behind the scenes there
is little enough of the romantic, I can tell you. I remember
another case of a girl, one of the prettiest and
best behaved we had&mdash;quite a modest little thing, in
fact. But she got picked up by a middle-aged rake,
and went to the bad. I do not know her whole story,
but I know she used to meet this fellow after the performance
very often. After a time she stated in confidence
to one of her companions that she was married
to him, and I have no doubt that she thought she was.
She left the theatre after a few weeks and went to live
with him. But I guess it didn't last long, for I saw
her several years afterwards in one of the lowest travelling
companies I know of, as vile and broken-down a
wreck as you ever saw. If there is any romance in the
lives of these girls, this is generally the style of it."</p>

<p>"Do these girls ever rise in the profession?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, some of our best actresses rise from the
ranks. It would make a cat laugh, though, to see the
first time they have a little speaking part in a regular
drama. A girl can get along all right as long as her
individuality is concealed in the ranks, but when she
has to step to the front and say a few words, she
waltzes up as though she was walking on eggs. She
looks as if she would like to fall through the stage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
swallows and hesitates, and puts you in doubt as to
whether you ought to laugh or pity her."</p>

<p>Here is a writer who takes another view of the
affair: "To the uninitiated male citizen the period of
supreme interest in affairs behind the scenes is the
period of a grand ballet or spectacular show, where a
hundred or two girls, who have undergone an examination
of their faces, shoulders and limbs, and been
accepted as presentable upon the stage, don tights and
make their bow to the public. It is not always easy
to secure the required number of girls who have the
requisite qualifications for an appearance in tights.
Girls who have never been on are extremely bashful
about making their first appearance. The majority of
the girls who answer the call for 'ladies for the ballet'
are shop girls, girls who take work to their
homes, girls suddenly thrown out of employment,
poor girls who have no other way of honestly earning
a dollar. There are a few who have been in the ballet
a number of times before. They have come to look
upon it very much as a business. They knit and sew
and crochet and do fancy-work behind the scenes during
the stage waits. Their pay is liberal compared
with what they can earn even in ways that are considered
more respectable, and they have the novelty and
excitement, which, of course, are something of an attraction
in themselves. Considerable judgment has to
be exercised in the selection of those who aspire to the
costume of a pair of tights and trunks or a gauze
dress. It is a lamentable fact that all ladies are not
plump and symmetrical, and for those lacking these
charms there is no door to the ballet stage. Once accepted
as a constituent part of a pageant which is to
disport itself before the foot-lights, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">figurante</i> has a
wide field for conquest open to her. It's man's weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
to be forever 'getting gone' on the favorites of
the foot-lights, to believe them all beautiful and luscious
as they seem from the front of the house. And so it is
that the watchman at the stage-door and call-boys divide
between them many a dollar for carrying in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">billet-doux</i>
from the great army of mashed masculines. 'Another
sucker dead gone,' mutters the call-boy as he pockets
his liberal fee as mail-carrier.
Perhaps the fair object of the
masher's admiration 'won't
have it,' but there are among
her sisters those who, to a
promisingly liberal and attractive
stranger, would not let the
lack of an introduction stand in
the way of their graciousness.
''Sh,' they say to the call-boy.
''Sh! Don't say a word. Tell
him we'll see him later. Look
for us at the stage-door when
our act is over.'"</p>

<p>And now let us see how they
do these things in France,
where the cancan nourishes and
the Jardin Mabille, with its
high kickers, is the temple towards
which pleasure-seeking pilgrims bend when they
visit their Mecca&mdash;La Belle Paris. A visitor to the
dancing green-room of the Grand Opera, there, will
find that at night it is brilliantly lighted, and the effect
of the gas-jets is greatly increased by the numerous
large mirrors which almost conceal the walls. In
front of each of these mirrors stands a wooden post a
little higher than one's waist, and before a dancing girl
sets off, she raises one foot after the other until she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
places it horizontally on one of these posts, where she
keeps it for some time, then quitting this position and
taking hold of the post with one hand she practices all
her steps, and after having in this way "set herself
off," she waters the floor with a handsome watering-pot,
and before the large mirrors, which reach down to
the mop-board, she goes through all the steps she is
about to dance on the stage. The leading dancing
girls commonly wear old pumps and small linen gaiters,
very loose, in order to avoid soiling their stockings or
stocking-net. When the call-boy gives his first notice,
they hasten to throw off their gaiters and put on new
pumps, chosen for their softness and suppleness,
whose seams they have carefully stitched beforehand.
The call-boy appears at the door, "Mesdemoiselles,
now's your time! the curtain is up!" and the flock of
dancing girls hasten to the stage. Among the Parisian
ballet corps one sees the strangest vicissitudes of fortune,
the most wonderful ups and downs of life.
Some, who yesterday were glad to receive the meanest
charity of their comrades, who joyfully accepted old
dancing pumps, and wore them for shoes, and faded
bonnets and thrice-mended clothes, appear to-day in
lace, silks, cashmeres, with coachman, valet, carriage
and pair. The sufferings, the privations, the fatigue,
and the courage of these poor girls ere the miserable
worm, the chrysalis, is metamorphosed into the brilliant
butterfly, cannot be conceived. Bread and water support
the life of more than half of them; many would
be glad to feel sure of it regularly twice a day. A
great number who live three or four miles from the
Grand Opera trudge that distance almost shoeless to
their morning dancing lesson, rehearsals, and evening
performances, and on their return home, long after
midnight, in the summer's rains and the winter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
snows, nothing buoys them up but the fond hope,
often delusive, that the future has a brighter and better
time in store for them.</p>

<p>The Nautch dancers, mentioned in the preceding
chapter, are consecrated to the temple from childhood,
and the graceful and fascinating poses to which the
people of this country have been introduced by an enterprising
American, are portions of their sacred dances
before the shrines of their dizzy deities. I think four
of these girls came to this country originally, and all
but one died. Still, there were forty so-called Nautch
dancers put upon the variety stage and in specialty
troupes, ordinary but clever American ballet girls
being painted for the occasion, and dressed in a semi-oriental
costume. They made no pretensions to do
the Nautch dance, in which the swaying of the body,
keeping time with the feet, and howling a lugubrious
hymn are the features, there being no hopping or
whirling around; but the fraudulent Nautch girls of
the specialty troupes pirouetted and pranced in the
steps of the old-time ballet, with which we all ought to
be familiar if we are not.</p>

<span class="subhead">TRAINING BALLET DANCERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"Well, now, I don't think that's so awful hard,"
said a fellow knight of the pencil, one evening as we
both leaned upon the rear row of chairs in the old
Theatre Comique at St. Louis, since destroyed by fire,
and bent our heads forward in an inquisitive look at
the ballet of "The Fairy Fountain," or something of
that sort. The remark was meant to apply to the
evolutions of the premiere as she spun around on one
toe and threw a graceful limb up towards the roof of
the house every time she gave a whirl.</p>

<p>"If you don't," said I, "you just try it once, and
you'll find out exactly how hard it is."</p>

<p>I had made this retort wildly and without knowing,
myself, anything much about the difficulties of ballet
dancing. It dawned on me that here was an excellent
field for inquiry, so having obtained the permission of
Manager W.&nbsp;C. Mitchell, who was running the
Comique, to go behind the scenes to interview the ballet
master; next evening found me early at the stage
door. I was soon inside picking my way through the
labyrinth of scenery, stage properties, scene shifters,
supers, actors and people generally who crowd and
jostle each other in this mimic world, and I was in imminent
danger every now and then of an <i>impromptu</i>
debut before the public, and of finding myself standing
figuratively on my head before an unappreciative
audience. At last the ballet master&mdash;Sig. J.&nbsp;F. Cardella,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
a thin, wiry man who seemed to be in the decline
of life&mdash;was found in his tights, leaning in an easy
attitude against one of the "wings."</p>

<p>"<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Bona sera, Signor</i>," I said in the best Italian I
could muster.</p>

<p>"<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Grazia</i>," returned the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maitre</i> in the most welcoming
manner in the world, as he invited me to a quiet
corner where we sat down on a cracker-box.</p>

<p>The object of the visit was briefly explained, and
Sig. Cardella rattled off his answers in a ready and
intelligible manner, the sweet Italian accents falling
from his tongue with the same rapidity and precision
that he twinkled his feet in the ballet when occasion
required. He said he had made his first appearance in
the ballet twenty years before, when he was twenty
years of age. He had been put in training, like other
children, at the age of twelve years, in the Theatre La
Scala&mdash;the government school&mdash;which has given
the world so many famous dancers. Here he remained
eight years.</p>

<p>"Children," said Cardella, "are admitted to this
school as early as ten years and as late as twelve,
and there is a regular routine of study that cannot be
finished in less than eight years. It is long and arduous,
and especially difficult when it is understood that
pupils in this country arrive at stage honors in an immensely
less time, in fact in as many months as we are
required to put in years of study in the old country."</p>

<p>"I suppose La Scala is under the tuition of the
very best masters," said I.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, indeed," responded the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maitre de ballet</i>,
assuringly; "my first teacher was the celebrated
Blozis, and after him Ousse, both French, and both
great masters."</p>

<p>"But old?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

  <div class="caption">DONNA JULIAS' EYES.</div></div>

<p>"Yes, old; but they had their stage triumphs, and
the recollection of these kept their limbs strong and
their joints almost as supple as they had been in their
younger years, when they themselves went forth from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
La Scala as premieres, to win the applause of the
public."</p>

<p>"Boys and girls are admitted to La Scala?"</p>

<p>"Boys and girls; but all must pass a physical
examination just as applicants for army service are
required to do. If they are fortunate in having been
endowed by nature with health and symmetry of form
they are received into the school and enter at once
upon its rigorous course of training. Oh, I tell you a
ballet school is not the same here as it is in the old
country. There must be perfect silence; not a word
from the moment the master appears before the line
of pupils, and after that nothing but the motions of
the hundred or more bodies and the beating of the
master's stick upon the floor."</p>

<p>"How long must they practice each day?"</p>

<p>"Well, before they are supposed to enter the
academy at all, they must have had one or two years'
practice outside. In the academy they have four
hours' practice under the direction of the master
every day; but many of them do more work than this,
especially the most ambitious. I used to practice from
eight to twelve hours daily, and even after having left
the academy I kept up my daily exercise for increasing
the limberness of the joints and the toughness of
the cartilages. The more practice, the nearer perfection."</p>

<p>"I suppose the pupils are divided into classes, are
they not?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we have four lines of dancers in Italy. You
have only three here. We place our coryphees fartherest
off from the premiere; you put them alongside.
The beginners at La Scala go into the coryphee class,
from which they are gradually advanced to the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">secunda lina</i>, then to the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">prima lina</i>, and, afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
to solo parts, when they practically become
premieres."</p>

<p>"But eight years," I suggested, "is a long time to
be working without any return in the shape of either
money or glory?"</p>

<p>"Ah, there you are mistaken," Cardella answered,
pleased to find that newspaper men sometimes make
mistakes. "The pupils at La Scala are paid something
from the time they enter the academy. They
first, while mere coryphees, get thirty francs a month;
in the second line, sixty francs; in the third, eighty;
and when advanced to solo parts, two hundred francs
a month. At this they stop until they finish their
schooling, when they take places in the principal
theatres, make the usual tour of the provinces and
of the continent, and finally settle down, if they have
not become famous, to some solid competency, just as
I have done myself."</p>

<p>"So much for the dancing boys and girls of Italy;
but how about the ballet in this country?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is nothing like what Europe produces.
You have no schools here except the theatres, and girls
when they come to learn the ballet, as they have often
came to me, ask: 'Do you think I can dance in a
week or two?' It is absurd the way they want to do.
Why, in my country I practised for eight years before
I would be allowed to appear publicly in the theatre,
and had practised two years before that at home, and
yet these American girls think they can become good
dancers in a week or two."</p>

<p>"What do you say to such applicants?"</p>

<p>"I say, 'No, you can't dance in a week or two,
nor in a month or two; but if you want to practice for
several months I can place you on the stage.' And I
say this because I know American girls can make good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
dancers if they are in earnest and apply themselves
hard; they can make passable ballet girls even if they
give only a fair share of their attention to the study."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the American ballet?"</p>

<div id="ip_89" class="figcenter" style="width: 326px;">
  <img src="images/i_257.jpg" width="326" height="381" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">MEASURING FOR THE COSTUME.</div></div>

<p>"It cannot be good, of course, as long as the public
does not give it the attention and patronage it requires
to make it good. In the old country the ballet is
everything; in this it is comparatively nothing. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
make it subservient to everything else on the stage.
Managers do not care to pay for good troupes, and the
troupes are consequently small and poor."</p>

<p>"But is there not plenty of employment for good
ballet dancers?"</p>

<p>"Always. Each company has few that can be
ranked as soloists, and this is because good dancers are
not numerous. As I have suggested before, the
American girl is not sufficiently ambitious in this line;
their stage yearnings are mostly for speaking parts on
the dramatic stage, and they are not very devout worshippers
at the shrine of Terpsichore."</p>

<p>"How are American ballet girls paid?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well; but nothing like what they got before
the war. Madame Gallati, who was my wife, before
the rebellion, never got less than $150 a week, and
after the war was paid $100. Premieres now do not
get more than $75, and they are in very good luck
when they get that much. The coryphees and others
get from $35 a week down as low as $15. And out of
this they must furnish their own wardrobes. They
must lay out from $5 a week upwards for their stage
clothes, and when a ballet is on that requires rich
dressing the wardrobes may exceed their whole week's
salary; but then, you know, they can prepare for an
emergency of this kind by laying by a portion of the
salary of the weeks in which no new ballet is brought
out. Some of the ballets run for a month, but the
usual run is two weeks."</p>

<p>"The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maitre</i> does not always dance?"</p>

<p>"No, he dances very seldom; but he earns his
money though. He is kept busy two or three hours
every day, Sunday included, teaching the old and
young ideas of the ballet, how to shoot out their
limbs, pose, pirouette, etc. It requires all the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
I can give to it to prepare a new ballet. Just as soon
as a new one is put on the stage I begin to train the
girls in another one, and this training is kept up until
the day before the novelty is to be presented to the
public. During this time of preparation I have the
entire troupe on the stage two hours every morning,
except matinee days, when, of course, there is no rehearsal.
I show them the steps and they have to
practice them. They are supposed to practice some at
home, but, of course, the majority of them never do
so."</p>

<p>"Have you many applicants now-a-days?"</p>

<p>"Not very many. Once in a while a girl or two
will apply, but nearly all of them are unworthy in
point of physique to be received, and so are sent away.
I do not care so much for nice features, for the ugliest
can be embellished sufficiently to look handsome before
the foot-lights but good forms are indispensable,
and particularly strong, symmetrical limbs. The applicants
come from all grades and classes of life, and
not a few are young girls of good but obscure connection,
who have ambition to win glory and money and
all that sort of thing from the public, and who fondly
imagine that the ballet girl lives a butterfly existence,
instead of being the hardworking, temptation-beset
creature that she really is."</p>

<p>"And they all want to get on the stage in a very
short time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the invariable question is, 'Can I dance in a
few weeks?' and then they want me to show them the
'steps' and to let them try to duplicate them. I tell
them there is no use; if they want to dance they must,
as the Irishman says, begin at the beginning. You
can't know music without learning the notes; you
can't read without knowing the A B C; and so with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>the ballet, you can't dance without first having acquired
its alphabet."</p>

  <div class="caption">M.&nbsp;B. CURTIS, IN SAM'L OF POSEN.</div></div>

<p>"How do you generally start a pupil out?"</p>

<p>"They have got to go to what we call the 'sideboard'
practice first; that is, they must take hold of something
for a rest, and go through the first five steps"&mdash;and
here the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maitre</i> got up from the cracker-box, and taking
hold of a "wing," placed his feet heel to heel, turned
them out straight without bending the knees into an
unsightly attitude, and said this was the first step; the
four others were much the same as the attitudes taken
at different times by elocutionists, one foot being pushed
forward and then another. "Then I show them how
to do this," and he began twisting one leg after another
backward and forward until I thought he would twist
both off, but he didn't. "After that," continued Sig.
Cardella, "which in this country takes about a month,
but in La Scala takes six months, I begin to show
them a step or two at a time, and gradually lead them
up until they know a little."</p>

<p>"But now and then we see a very fresh and green
foot, if I may use the expression, on the stage."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course; we've got to make up a fair number
for a troupe sometimes, and I then allow a girl to
go on, whom I think smart enough not to make a fool
of herself. You see although the American girl is
smart and sharp, and pretty original in many other
things, she is entirely imitative in dancing. She
watches the other girls, and although she may not even
be fairly grounded in the fundamental principles of
ballet dancing, she frequently faces an audience and
does well&mdash;sometimes astonishingly well in fact. Some
of these girls climb up out of the ranks very fast; others
who are lazy and give too much time to flirting and
drinking wine, remain in the same line, usually the last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
for years, and are really in a ballet master's way all the
time."</p>

<p>"How are ballet girls as a class?"</p>

<p>"Some of them," said Cardella, with a shake of his
head and an expression of pity on his face, "are a little
fond and foolish at times."</p>

<p>"And they have their admirers who bother them, in
and out of the theatre, and send them pretty presents,
big boquets and such?"</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">A PREMIERE BEFORE THE AUDIENCE.</span></div></div>

<p>"Oh well, now, I know very little about that. Some
of them have families to support, and manage to wear
better clothes and more jewelry than their salaries
could pay for. I could tell you lots of funny incidents
about ballet girls, billet-doux and Billy boys, but you
see that nigger act is nearly through, and I've got to
go and look after my girls." And with an "<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Adio,
Signor!</i>" and a wave of his hand, he withdrew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
I went up to the Alcazar on Monday night to see
Bonfanti dance. I have a great respect for Bonfanti.
She is a woman of character. When she first danced
here the town was wild about her, and one young man,
the son of rich and proud parents, offered her his
hand in marriage. She hesitated for awhile, but he
argued that because he was rich and his parents proud
was no reason that he should be made unhappy by her
refusal to marry him. She thought it over and came
to the conclusion that he was right. So Mlle. Bonfanti
became Mrs. Hoffman forthwith. The hue and
cry raised by the Hoffmans was so violent that the
young man could not stand it, and took his wife to
Europe. His family allowed him little or no money,
and he, having been very unpractically educated, could
find no means of support. He was delicate and he fell
ill and died. Then Bonfanti, or Mrs. Hoffman, came
to New York to claim her rights as the wife of the
son and heir of the Hoffmans, but they behaved in
a way that wounded her pride&mdash;for ballet dancers as
well as Hoffmans have pride&mdash;and she declined to
accept any aid from them whatever. "As long as I
have my feet to dance with," she said, "I can take
care of myself, and I want none of their money." So
she went back to the ballet, and has been dancing ever
since. I couldn't help thinking as I looked at her the
other night, that scions of proud New York families
had often made worse matches. She has a good and
still handsome face, and she dances as gracefully as
ever. She is modest even when pointing at the foot-lights
with one toe and at the chandelier with the other.
Bonfanti is not one of the grinning dancers. Her face
wears a rather sad expression, and she only smiles in
acknowledgment of the applause of the audience.
The competition with Lepri makes her do her best,
and it is a regular dancing match every night.</p>

<span class="subhead">PLAYS AND PLAYWRIGHTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At seven o'clock one morning during the season of
1881&ndash;2 a tall, gawky, angular-looking young man in a
suit of smutty and wrinkled gray, under a battered
slouch hat with a bandit curl to its wide brim, stood at
the door of one of the rooms of the Southern Hotel in
St. Louis. He had a big bundle under his arm, and
seemed tired, as indeed he was, for he had climbed four
pairs of stairs and walked the lower hall-ways from one
end to the other looking for the room which he had now
found. He knocked kindly at first, but got no answer;
knocked again with the same result, and again and
again. The fifth time somebody said "Come in,"
and the young man twisted the knob and in a moment
was standing at the bedside of the late Oscar G. Bernard,
business manager of the Couldock-Ellsler Hazel
Kirke Company. Bernard was still in bed and very
sleepy.</p>

<p>"I've got a play I want to read to you," said the
young man, shifting the bundle he had under his arm
down into his hands, where Mr. Bernard could see it.</p>

<p>"A what?" the manager exclaimed, rising hurriedly
upon his elbow and looking out through drowsy eyelids
at a pile of foolscap manuscript big enough to fill
a French Cyclopedia.</p>

<p>"A play," was the visitor's answer, in a quiet, unalarmed
tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
"Is that it?" Bernard asked, as he eyed the package
of manuscript with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; there are only 439 pages."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all? How many characters, scenes,
and acts, and how long do you think it would take to
play it?" asked the manager, trying to be as sarcastic
as possible.</p>

<p>"There are forty-seven characters in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dramatis
personæ</i>," the playwright answered, nothing daunted,
"nine acts, and it might take three hours or more to
play it through."</p>

<p>"How many people get killed in it?"</p>

<p>"Only thirteen."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" said the manager; "go and kill off
thirty more of 'em and then you will have a play worth
talking about. You've got to kill somebody off every
five minutes to make it stick. You needn't leave any
more of them alive than just enough to group into a
happy tableau at the end of the last act."</p>

<p>"I don't think I can do it," said the playwright.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can," the manager insisted. "Just
try it once; and here, take this pass and go and see
'Hazel Kirke' to-night. It plays only until eleven
o'clock, and we don't think it quite long enough. If
you could tone your play down so that we might use
it for a kind of prologue or something of that sort it
would be better."</p>

<p>The young man took the pass and departed. He
was the queerest dramatist the country and century have
produced, except possibly A.&nbsp;C. Gunter. He was fully
six feet high, large and sharp-featured, with a light
like lunacy dazzling in his black eyes and across his
sallow face. His hands were large and his feet big, and
as he ambled along the hotel hall he looked like an
over-grown plowboy who had suddenly and mysteriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
turned book-peddler. Besides all this he seemed
very hungry.</p>

<p>Early the next morning he was at Bernard's bedside
again. He had seen "Hazel Kirke," and thought over
the manager's advice, but had not made the changes
suggested because he was of the opinion now more
than ever that the play would suit Mr. Bernard.
Would the manager allow him to read it out to him?
Its title was "Love and the Grave." The manager
said he might leave the manuscript to be looked over
during the day, but the dramatist said he preferred to
read it so that none of the good points would be lost.
Then the manager told him to call again. He called
again early the next morning. The manager was still
too busy and too sleepy to hear the play. The dramatist
said he hated to part from his manuscript; he had
been five years writing the play, but he liked Mr.
Bernard and would leave it with him for twenty-four
hours. The manager suggested that there was a possibility
of the play being lost if the hotel were to take
fire, but the young man answered that he had ascertained
that the hotel was fire-proof, and he was willing
to take the chances. He went away leaving the voluminous
manuscript in the manager's possession. Of
course Bernard didn't read it, but when the dramatist
returned Friday morning he told him it was very good,
and if the dramatist cared he could give him a letter
to the manager of a Chinese theatre in San Francisco,
who would be glad to purchase and produce such a play.
The dramatist hoisted his manuscript under his arm,
said he was sorry the Madison Square people couldn't
use it, and went out hungrier-looking and more awkward
than ever. Bernard hoped that it was the last of him.</p>

<p>But it was not. While Bernard was in John T.
Raymond's room the following afternoon a knock was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
heard at the door and in walked the dramatist. He
did not recognize Mr. Bernard but told Raymond in
piteous tones that the man he (Raymond) had recommended
him to would not allow him to read the play,
and didn't want it. A light flashed upon Bernard.
Raymond laughed heartily. Bernard did not laugh.
It was one of the comedian's practical jokes. He had
sent the Illinois dramatist to the "Hazel Kirke" manager
with positive instructions to insist upon reading
the Chinese play to him. After the comedian had had
his laugh, he pulled a nickel with a hole in it out of
his pocket, and, turning to the playwright, <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll match you for
the play. If I win I take the manuscript. If you win
you take the nickel."</p>

<p>The dramatist was disgusted. He said all he wanted
was money enough to get back to Springfield, Ill.,
where he edited a daily paper. If he had that he would
be happy. Bernard and Raymond each gave him a
$5 bill and sent him on his way rejoicing.</p>

<p>The trials and tribulations of the gawky young dramatist
from the Sucker State is but a slightly exaggerated
and caricaturish recital of the difficulties that have
been lying in the path of American dramatists ever
since we made anything like an attempt at a distinctively
national dramatic literature. It has been all
along, pretty much the same with the young American
who wrote a play as it was with the seedy English
authors of Sheridan's time. Fresh from his garret,
and as hungry for fame and fortune as he was badly in
need of a meal, the young man who had written a
drama appeared in shabby-genteel attire at the door of
the manager's office, and after introducing himself,
handed over his manuscript, which was tossed into a
drawer or box, while the poor author, trembling with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
agitation, was told to return in a week or month. You
may be sure the days and nights were nervously passed
until the appointed time rolled around. Then, bright
and early, still hopeful and still hungry, the author
was at the manager's door.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what do you wish?" was the abrupt and
startling greeting accorded the author.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have read my <span class="locked">play"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"What play?"</p>

<p>The author names it and the manager sternly says:
"No, sir, I haven't read it and know nothing about it.
When did you leave it here?"</p>

<p>"A month ago, sir."</p>

<p>"Well I don't think it would do me any good to
read it. I haven't either the time or the inclination.
If you want it search in that box, and if you can't find
your own you can take your choice of any of those in
there."</p>

<p>This was, of course, a crusher. The young author
moved away with a bleeding heart, and his armful of
manuscript, and the stage to which his hopes and ambition
had been attracted probably never offered him
an opportunity to have his play damned on a first
night. American dramatists are to-day pretty much
in the same plight in regard to American managers
and the American stage. Very few of our dramatic
authors have received proper recognition, and few who
have toiled at writing and dramatizing for years have
much fame or money to show for their work. American
managers have a rage for foreign works, and just
now are pouring thousands of dollars into the pockets
of English and French playwrights, whose work is by
no means superior to that to be found in the home
market. Some years ago that very successful play of
"The Two Orphans" was purchased by an American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
from its French author for a mere song. Now, Sardou
gets $10,000 for a play like "Odette," which has
so far, I believe, failed to bring that amount back to
Mr. French, the purchaser. Samuel Colville paid
Messrs. Pettitt &amp; Merritt, of London, an enormous
sum for the melodrama of "The World," which, however,
made $75,000 for him. Messrs. Brooks &amp;
Dickson bought "Romany Rye," an untried play,
from Sims, for America, paying him $10,000 cash;
Colville paid a high price for "Taken from Life,"
and D'Oyley Carte planks down $12,000 to Mr. Sims
for a drama, before a line of it is written, and sells the
American right to Lester Wallack on the same terms.</p>

<p>All the American actors, actresses and managers
nowadays want foreign plays and are willing to
pay exorbitant prices for everything that is offered.
On the other hand it is the exception when an American
playwright does well, or indeed when his work is accepted
at all. Some few late successes this side of
the water have set all the ambitious young men of play-writing
proclivities to work. One day it will be announced
that John McCullough has bought a tragedy
from a rising journalist, and next day all the journalists
will be writing plays for him. So, too, with Raymond,
and Mary Anderson, and a score of others.
But, few writers among journalists succeed in dramatic
work. Robert G. Morris, of the New York <i>Telegram</i>,
is among the latest successes with his "Old Shipmates,"
and probably one of the greatest is Bartley Campbell,
who sprang into fame in a night, after plodding
patiently and poorly paid for years. Fred. Marsden,
who writes Lotta's plays, is also among the fortunate,
having, according to report, during his career made
something like $70,000.</p>

<p>Bartley Campbell may be taken as an excellent example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
of the manner in which the American dramatist
works, and the almost despairing circumstances attending
his long and weary chase of fortune. He is a man
with a history. That history he made himself. From
an office boy he has risen to a place of honor. Not
that the position of office boy is dishonorable, but very
few who begin life in that sphere ever attain as high a
place as that now enjoyed by the greatest of our
American dramatists. He was born at Pittsburg,
Pennsylvania, some thirty-seven years ago, and as
soon as he graduated from the lap of infancy he entered
a lawyer's office with the view of studying for
the bar. But the reading of law he soon discovered
was not at all to his liking, and he was declared an unpromising
student, being too poetic and sentimental.
His next move was to the office of the Pittsburg
<i>Leader</i>, where he himself says he received the munificent
salary of $5 a week for the hardest work he has
ever done. Here is another illustration of the old
saying, that when you have failed at everything else
make up your mind to adopt the profession of actor or
journalist. Young Campbell chose the latter. He
preferred the stationary drudgery of a newspaper Bohemian's
existence to the wandering chance-life of the
equally hard worked, and, at that time, poorly paid
actor. By diligence and close application to study he
rose rapidly, and soon was entrusted with the responsible
position of dramatic critic. He must have been a
good one. It is said that he was a faithful critic; so
faithful, indeed, as to warrant the chastisement of a
bad actor, and endanger the publication of the paper
with libel suits. He deserted the <i>Leader</i> and commenced
publishing the <i>Mail</i>, and it is here, while editing
this journal, that he first attempted play-writing.
His early effort was the sensational drama called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
"Through the Fire," brought out in 1871; then followed
the comedy, "Peril," produced in 1872; the
third was, "Fate," which was subsequently purchased
by Miss Carlotta Leclerq, who played it with much
success for several years; then followed, "Risks,"
now the property of John T. Raymond, and, in swift
succession, the mill ground out "The Virginian,"
"On the Rhine," "Gran Uale," "The Big Bonanza,"
which, it will be remembered, was one of the successes
of 1875. "A Heroine in Rags," "How Women
Love" (later known as "The Heart of the Sierras,"
and still later as "The Vigilantes"), "Clio," "Fairfax,"
"My Partner," and lastly, "The Galley Slave."
It was the success of "My Partner" that brought
about the turning-point in Mr. Campbell's fortune.
That he had suffered the severity of want, he
confesses himself in a neat little Christmas story told
by him to a newspaper correspondent, who met him at
the door of Haverly's Theatre, New York, one night
during the run of "The Galley Slave" in the metropolis.
His tall figure, his slouch hat, rather dishevelled
hair, twelve-cornered moustache, Prince Albert coat
and disordered necktie looked just as they did when I
first saw their owner some years ago, when his luck
was away down. The statement of the night's receipts
was brought him while we stood there, and his
share was a few dollars more than six hundred.</p>

<p>"House not as good as last night," he said, "within
a couple of dollars. Fact is, the business, although
good, has not been better than it might be."</p>

<p>"Why, Bartley, you don't quarrel about a couple
of dollars, now you are in the height of success?
What is your income from plays, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I don't growl about a few dollars; but now is the
time&mdash;see? When you can growl about them do it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Well, I'm getting on an average $1,500 a week now."</p>

<p>"You'll soon be rich, Bartley."</p>

<p>"Well, I am so accustomed to bad luck, perhaps I
may meet some&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>Bartley Campbell always says "see" in an interrogative
way without much or any desire for an answer.
In a rambling conversation about his varied
career that followed, the drift of the talk got Christmas
and poverty mixed, and Bartley told this story of
his early struggles: "I had just gone to New Orleans
with my wife, arriving there just when a newspaper
had suspended, and twelve writers were, like myself,
seeking journalistic work&mdash;only, unlike myself, they
had acquaintances and friends; I neither; nor money,
except five cents&mdash;see? The row was a hard one.
After various 'shifts'&mdash;one of which was starting the
<i>Southern Magazine</i>, which was brought out&mdash;we
found ourselves, just before Christmas time, with
nothing of importance except a grocery bill&mdash;see? I
wrote a poem about Eddystone Light, and sent it to
the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, then published in Charleston,
S.&nbsp;C., by Felix de Fontaine &amp; Co. It was the small
beginning of which the present <i>Nineteenth Century</i> is
the great result&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>"Well, I marked on the MS.&mdash;price $15. Commercial
poetry&mdash;see? We confidently expected that
money before Christmas. Why, we took it as a matter
of course that the money must come. If it
didn't&mdash;well, that was a view of things that we
couldn't take for a moment&mdash;see? Well, the day
before Christmas came, but that money did not. I
visited the post-office again and again that day, but no
letter. The situation was gloomy then, and in the
evening I said to my wife, 'I guess I'll have to go to
the grocery, anyway.' 'I wouldn't go, Bart,' she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
said; 'I am afraid he'll say something about the account.'
'I can't help it&mdash;I am going, anyhow,' I
answered, and grabbed the basket and rushed out,
for fear that my wife's fears would deter me from
going at all&mdash;see? He didn't say anything about the
account, and I ordered sparingly. When he got the
things all in the basket, he slipped in with them a
bottle of nice liquor, and he said: 'Now, Mr. Campbell,
this is Christmas Eve.' I went home, and I
drank some of the liquor, and when we went to bed
things looked a little brighter. I got up in the morning,
and they were gloomy again&mdash;see? I started
down to the post-office, my wife saying it was a fruitless
errand, and got there just before the Christmas
rule of closing at 10 <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> shut down the delivery
window. The clerk ran through every letter, and
when he had got to the last one, and as I half turned
to leave, he threw me down a letter which bore the
date mark 'Charleston.' I opened it, and there was
a check for $15. My legs couldn't carry me home
fast enough. I got there, and my wife met me, her
face all aglow. 'Well, Bart,' she said. 'Well,' I
said, and I felt that she had heard the news&mdash;that
some one had told her my check had come, for to me
it was the biggest piece of news ever was, and that it
was common talk was perfectly natural. 'Bartley, I
have got $10,' she cried. 'And I have got $15,' I
yelled; and she, not noticing it, went on, 'I sold the
war book about women, that nobody would buy before,
to some people who wanted it. Now, don't be
extravagant, Bartley, please.' We had a bottle of
champagne that day, and presently I got the position
of official reporter of the Legislature at $16 a week; but
Christmas time never comes that I do not wonder if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
will have as merry and happy a day as the one we
celebrated in New Orleans just after the war."</p>

<p>In view of what has been said about the almost merciless
treatment the American dramatist, as a general
rule, receives from the American theatrical manager,
it may be well to add here the statement made lately
by Mr. William Seymour, stage manager of the Madison
Square Theatre, New York. He exhibited to a
visitor a drawerful of manuscripts, and said, although
he had read and rejected one hundred and fifty plays
within nine months, he still had almost as many more
left. As a usual thing the plays offered were, he
claimed, weak imitations of "Hazel Kirke" and kindred
plays, or wretched translations from the German
or French. One or two were very original attempts.
Picking up a heavy manuscript bound with blue ribbon,
and looking very like a young girl's graduating
essay or poem, Mr. Seymour said: Here is a play in
seven acts, which opens in America at some large seaport
town, the author isn't particular where, and an
embarkation scene ends the first act. In the second
the ship has made its way in toward the Arctic regions
and is wrecked by an iceberg. The hero bravely cuts
down a spar, lashes himself to it and jumps overboard.
In the third act he is discovered upon an iceberg
beyond the Arctic circle, starving and almost
dead, while in the distance a battle is in progress between
a pirate ship and Chinese junk. The Chinamen
are destroyed, and in the fourth act the hero
is rescued from the iceberg. A marine encounter
between Chinamen and pirates in the Arctic Ocean is
bad enough, but even this is outdone in the fifth act,
where the hero is discovered upon a tropical island
with his feet frostbitten. The remaining two acts are
used to get him back to America, which is done in full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
accordance with the rest of the play. I have many
others just as bad. Here is one with fifty-two speaking
characters, and here is another in four acts, which
would require but twenty-nine minutes to play the
whole thing through. But strange and curious as the
plays are, I think that the letters I receive from the
authors are still greater curiosities. Occasionally
some of them are modest enough to admit the possibility
of failure, but as a general thing they do not
hesitate to dwell upon the beauties of their productions
and the certainties of success. Moreover, they are always
ready to make terms and some of their offers
are very amusing. Here is one that will serve as a
<span class="locked">sample:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The masher is a remarkable creature. He hovers
everywhere, from the market-place to the meeting-house
and from the promenade to the theatre. He is
many-phased and many-faced, and may come from the
slums or be the son of a first-class preacher of the Gospel.
The class has been termed gunaikophagists by
some fellow reckless
alike of the
feelings of philologists
and of the
jaws of the rising
generation, who
says it means woman-eaters,
but
may be less poly-syllabically
styled
corner loafers and
miserable scoundrels,
who live on
the curbs and in
some instances
hug the wall&mdash;have a pardonable affection, considering
that they part their hair in the middle,
for malacca, bamboo, and rubber sticks&mdash;and
last, but not least, some indulge a precocious
vanity by planting eye-glasses across their
noses. These are, par excellence, the cane-and-eyeglass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
friends, and they remind one of nothing else in
the world than a sickly looking cross between a
saw-buck and a half-resuscitated dried herring. The
masher's sole ambition, is to win hearts, which he hopes
to do by staring ladies out of countenance, and which
he often does in a most flagrant and audacious manner.
There are young and old of this class, and they are of
all grades, from the young man who negotiates with
you over a counter for a paper of pins or a dozen shoestrings,
up to his employer, and from that up the
monetary scale to the man who wholesales the employer
the pins which the "mashing" salesman disposes
of a nickle's worth at a time. Sandwiched
between these at proper, or rather improper, intervals
are the "What d'ye soy?" crowd, the "toughs"
wearing high felt hats turned up with care before and
behind, and, without exception, sporting the inevitable
tight jeans breeches. Their influence extends only to
a certain class&mdash;to the concert and variety dives&mdash;and
it is unfortunate to the poor girls, outside of this class,
who fall a prey to these ruthless "mashers."</p>

<p>The theatre appears to possess loadstone qualities
for the masher; it is as attractive to them as the flame
of the candle is for the moth or the flower for the bee.
I have already in a preceding chapter said a great deal
about the "mashing" that is done in the audience by
both male and female exponents of the disreputable
art. I shall now confine myself to the "mashers" in
the profession and those who try to "mash" the profession.
Some young gentlemen with more money
than brains imagine that actresses have nothing else
to do but receive attentions from the opposite sex, and
that there is no "wall of China" around the virtue of
any woman on the stage. They therefore not only make
bold to talk freely about actresses, but are valiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
enough to try to ensnare them by letters abounding in
hyperbole and odorescent of cologne-besprent idiocy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
The variety actress is the ideal prize of this class, and
they are in their greatest glory when within the frolicsome
precincts of the wine-room. I have seen many a
young man whose hair was parted in the middle crow
lustily over the successful capture of a ballet girl, when
he himself had been the capture. These girls know
what their charms are worth and hold them at that
price, when they see a victim well dressed and with
an apparently healthy pocket-book. They, in expressive
but slangy language, lay for him. They are not
foolish enough to invite him to their side; they allow
him to make an apparent conquest which guarantees
them all the greater gain. The young gentleman of
whom I speak was lured in this way; and as she sat
with well-rounded limbs pulsating through silken tights
and gracefully thrown upon an opposite chair, and he
leant over her whispering soft words and looking
fondly upon her painted face, while they clinked champagne
glasses, she with downcast eyes was playing
innocence, but all the while congratulating herself upon
the arch manner in which she had won him.</p>

<p>Just as bad as the female "masher" on the stage
is the female "masher" who has no claims on the
profession. The latter has studied her art perfectly,
that it may assist her in throwing her net about the
unsophisticated. Females of this class in the East
make it their business to frequent the matinees, where
with the assistance of the ushers, whom they remunerate
handsomely for their co-operation, they gather a
granger in, and within twelve hours or so send him
home whining at his idiocy in not having resisted the
temptation that left him penniless. The gay sirens
who are in this business generally go in pairs. The
usher locates them next to their victim, and once there
they've got him for all the cash he took out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>family sock before leaving Jerusha and his eight little
ones.</p>

<p>The blonde beauties of the leg drama, or the fair
burlesquers, as some people call them, are considered
legitimate prey by the "mashing" fraternity. Indeed
it is often a case of diamond cut diamond, for the burlesquers
are themselves notoriously liberal in making
acquaintances, and the majority of them will accept a
midnight drive or a morning supper as readily as they
do the friendship of the gentleman who tenders them.
The bewildering array of limbs and shapely forms, the
golden hair and apparently fresh and handsome faces
set the young swells wild, and the rush for orchestra
chairs down front where a quiet flirtation can be carried
on shows the great extent of rivalry that exists
among their number. Any number of scented notes
on rose-tinted paper find their way through the stage-door
into the hands of the giddy throng behind the
scenes, and as they glance through it they laugh at
the foolishness of the writer but agree to "work him"
to the full extent of his wealth. The comedian who
knows that the girls have got "another sucker on a
string" comes up and wants to see the last "letter
from home." He gives the girls a funny bit of advice
about retaining their innocence if they would be happy,
but adds that if there is anything in the fellow, to
"catch on" at once&mdash;which of course the girls have
already made up their minds to do.</p>

<p>A veteran in the business says: "Actresses have the
most marked talents for wheedling the gilded youth
out of money. Such 'guys' and 'gillies' fancy that
if they are known as the patrons and friends of stage
stars all the world is staring at them and envying
their conquests. Poor idiots, their entire conquest
consists in that they make over their own common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
sense! The silly ninny rejoicing in the showy and artful
woman's favors counts himself a privileged mortal,
but his chief privilege in regard to a cunning, scheming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
stage siren is the privilege of paying her bills. Of
the men with money she makes fools. When she
scents a full pocket-book she runs it low. Her affection,
so far as she has any to bestow, is probably lavished
on a big animal of a loafer from whom she gets
no money, and who, perhaps, beats her and makes her
support him. It is a paradox of feminine nature that
the women who are unscrupulous and heartless in
wheedling men of money seem so lavishly free in bestowing
favors and bounty on loaferish lovers, from
whom they can make nothing. An actress is psychically
a study, always curious and unaccountable, however
talented."</p>

<p>Some comic opera choruses, particularly those of the
limb-exhibiting kind, have attained to almost equal
notoriety with the burlesquers in the "mashing" line.
The fact of the matter is that in the branches of the
profession where women are employed, not for their
artistic qualities, but on account of the plumpness of
their limbs and the agreeableness of their entire figure
to the male eye, there is so much laxness and so much
that is altogether bad, that the ladies of the higher
walks of the profession do not always escape, and the
"masher," who is always going around seeking what
fair females he may devour, frequently dares to approach
some of the best women in the profession. Here
is a specimen of the work of one of this class; it is a
letter received by one of the best and handsomest little
ladies the stage ever saw, and whose retirement from the
boards was really a great loss to the dramatic <span class="locked">art:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

you before to-night, but to see you is to be dazed&mdash;glamoured
with a glare. May I dare to hope that I
shall ever stand abashed in your presence, waiting your
sweet will to raise my eyes to your dear face in adoration?
Tell me that I may follow you through all the
world upon my bended knees, to find at last your
favor, that I may live in hope upon the memory of
your smile, and know that at the last you will be content
to let me kneel at your feet and find reward in

<p>Can anybody imagine a more glowing and positive
piece of idiocy? This would-be "masher" should be
taken out in the woods and brained with a five-syllable
adjective that he would not be able to identify in the
next world. Many actresses refuse to receive letters
that are sent to them from strange admirers. Mary
Anderson never sees such a letter, although bushels of
them are sent to her. And she is only one of hundreds
who adopt the policy of rejecting strange letters
at sight. Frequently married ladies in the profession
are made targets of by the letter-writing brigade of
mashers, and more than one head has been artistically
mutilated as a return for the "masher's" impertinent
pains.</p>

<p>A New York correspondent writes as follows about
a pretty little actress and singer, who while fulfilling
an engagement at the Bijou Opera House, New York,
last summer, broke the hearts of all the "swells"
and "bloods" of the metropolis, and had the house
filled nightly with rival admirers, among whom was
the melancholy son of a Washington, D.&nbsp;C., judge:
"Miss Lillian Russell is a beauty without a shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
of doubt. She is about twenty-six, I believe. It is
by no means generally known that she is married, and
that her husband is an honest, hard-working, and thorough
orchestra leader, to whom she owes her present
proficiency in vocal culture. He was very fond of her,
and always believed in her success. No man could
have worked more faithfully. Finally he found an
opening for her on the variety stage as a serio-comic&mdash;as
the phrase goes&mdash;singer. She attracted attention
at once, and he labored vigilantly until he found a
legitimate opening in English comic opera. I believe
it was 'The Snake Charmer.' She was very glad to
get out of the variety rut so soon, and expressed delight
at the admiration she excited. Then came the
club-men with their swell slang, gaudy carts and flowing
money. Now she is suing her husband for divorce.
Such is life. The husband, I hear, harassed by care,
and perhaps something else, had become so nervous
or inattentive that he lost his position in the orchestra,
and so the shades of prosperity and adversity are more
clearly defined than ever. Miss Russell seems to have
been under the especial care of a theatrical goddess of
sensationalism. Everything has conspired to make
her name familiar. Her escapade with one of the
young men was inevitable. The only question was
which one she would select. It happened to be
Howard Osborne, the son of the wealthy banker.
One night when it was time for the curtain to rise, and
the audience was getting into a white heat, the manager
came forward displaying a decided desire to swear
like a pirate, and announced that Miss Russell had
suddenly and unwarrantedly run away. The next
morning Mr. Osborne, Sr., wondered where in thunder
his son was. He received a letter later, and
immediately fell into a howling rage. Shortly afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Mr. Howard Osborne was heard of in Chicago,
whence it was blandly stated Miss R. had gone to visit
an aunt. The young man was sent spinning over the
sea to Europe, and the steamer had just arrived when
his fond parent had the exquisite pleasure of reading
at breakfast a cable in the morning papers relating a
little excursion of a certain Mr. Howard Osborne, Esq.,
said to be of New York, with Miss Alice Burville, the
burlesque actress, at the Ascot races. Heigho!
'Which the ways of the world is peculiar, Mrs. 'Arris,
sez I.'"</p>

<p>A Californian, who reached the Pacific slope in '49
as a peddler, but is now a bachelor millionaire, has
been sued for breach of promise by the walking lady
of a San Francisco theatre, who seems to have effectually
succeeded in "mashing" the old man. The
defendant it is said first saw the plaintiff at a performance
at the theatre where she was engaged. He
became impressed with her charms and sought an introduction.
He gained it and became an assiduous
attendant upon her. Their intimacy, the lady
alleges, ended in a promise of marriage, and she
claims to possess letters in which she is addressed by
those endearing epithets good husbands apply to the
spouses they love. However that may be, the defendant
showered bounties on her, both in jewels and
money, for upwards of a year. Then business called
him to his mines in Amador County. He was to be
away some weeks, but returned sooner than he had
anticipated. He drove directly to the theatre where
the plaintiff was performing at the time of his arrival
in San Francisco, and got there just in time to see
her walk away with another man. That other
man, moreover, was an actor with whom rumor
had associated her name more than once, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
she had succeeding in arguing suspicion in the
matter away from the mind of her senile lover.
This time, however, argument failed to do the work
required of it. Detectives employed by the defendant
resulted in the discovery that his gifts and favors had
only served to benefit a younger and more fascinating
man, and he literally as well as metaphorically shook
the dust of his false one's door-mat off his feet forever.
Then followed the suit, which he calls blackmail, and
she, a demand for justice.</p>

<p>Adelina Patti is credited with a strange fascination,
while in New York, the diva having succumbed to the
blandishments of a midget. The story is that she saw
a picture of the midget Dudley Foster on exhibition
at Bunnell's museum, and driving down Broadway,
stopped at Bunnell's establishment and asked George
Starr, the wily and polite manager, for the loan of the
diminutive specimen of humanity. Starr agreed and
the midget was handed into her carriage. "Here is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
pretty toy," gushed the prima donna, covering the
little creature with kisses. She took him to her hotel
and passed an entire afternoon singing to him and
chatting. How Nicolini took to the new crank of his
singing bird is not stated. Mr. Foster plumes himself
considerably on the fact that he has done what princes
have tried in vain&mdash;cut out Nicolini&mdash;and he boasts,
too, that the prima donna before she would let him go
made him promise to call on her the following week.</p>

<p>Actors have their "mashes" too, the same as actresses,
and the gentlemen who own flexible voices, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
flourish them through all the glorious variations of
operatic music, seem to be most successful in captivating
the fair and susceptible sex. "It is hard to understand
why it is," says a Chicago newspaper, "but
somehow, while girls recognize the powder and paint,
the blonde wigs and penciled brows of a prima donna
as so much make-up, they refuse to analyze the charms
of a tenor, and his grease, paint, luxuriant locks, and
graceful moustache are admired as his very own. A
case in point was that of a young lady whose father is
well known on the Chicago Stock Exchange. She was
violently smitten with Campanini, and used to send
him no end of beautifully written missives, and every
night a bouquet of red roses. The letters especially
attracted the attention of the tenor because they were
written in smoothly flowing Italian, and evidently by
some one who was more romantic than fast or wild.
There was little trouble in finding out the fair correspondent,
and Mme. Campanini, who has a good and
lovely soul, sent a note to the young lady and asked
her to call. It is needless to say the latter's delightful
delusions were quickly dispelled before the domestic
life of the silver-toned tenor and the kindly advice
of his good wife.</p>

<p>The extent to which these serio-comic love affairs
are carried on is enormous, and sometimes the parties
show an amusing ingenuity in their correspondence.
Del Puente once went nearly wild with ungratified
curiosity through the pranks of a mischievous school
girl, who was perpetually sending him love letters, in
which she declared she never missed a single night
when he sung, and that when he left New York on his
tour with Her Majesty's Company she should follow
him and be present at every performance. Sure
enough, in every city where he sang he received a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
pretty note of congratulation, with the usual information
that the writer&mdash;dressed, as usual, in black&mdash;was
present. Of course, there were always a number
of young and pretty women in this sombre hue, but
which was his correspondent Del Puente never could
decide. The letters were always post-marked with the
name of the city he happened to be in, and finally he
became really nervous with the idea of an unknown
woman following him in this shadowy fashion. His
curiosity was not destined to be satisfied until long
afterward, when he found that the fair unknown, cleverly
following the published route, would send a
stamped but undirected letter to the postmaster of the
city he happened to be in, with a request that he would
ascertain the singer's address and forward it. As long
as the letter was stamped this was sure to be done, and
the tenor never failed to receive the missive.</p>

<p>A case of basso-infatuation was that of a daughter
of an ex-Senator, still prominent in Washington circles,
who used to spend all her pin-money in buying
presents and baskets of flowers, which she sent to
Conley. In some mysterious way her father received
a hint of it, and the young lady was sent to the
Georgetown convent, where she was educated for a
couple of years by way of punishment. She probably
did not know that Conley was married. Poor fellow,
he was drowned last summer.</p>

<p>Castle, though neither so young nor so charming as
he once was, still receives loads of gushing epistles,
which Mrs. Castle demurely twists into cigar lighters;
and Brignoli says, "I haf teached misself ze Inglis
language with these liddle letters."</p>

<p>In Chicago there resides a wealthy and charming
young married lady who entertains handsomely, and is
well known in society, but who distracts her elderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
husband by a mania for making the acquaintance of
every new male singer of note, and entertaining him
with the greatest elegance and expense. Of course a
majority of these affairs are entered into either in the
spirit of romance or mischief, but in either case it is
apt to result disastrously, and the world has a cruelly
uncomfortably way of stamping them with another and
harsher name.</p>

<p>Having noticed that there was a stain on the lips of
the portrait of Campanini the tenor, hanging in the
lobby of the Academy of Music, New York, a visitor
called an attendant's attention to it and advised him to
wipe it off. "Why, bless you," said the attendant, "we
do so every day. That's where the girls kiss it. That
picture makes as many mashes as Campy himself, and
if he was kissed half as often his lips would be quite
worn away. Lord what fools women are, to be sure!"
The visitor waited long enough to see a well-dressed
and handsome young lady approach and kiss the picture.
At least he says he saw it.</p>

  <div class="caption">A MONKEY SPOILING A "MASH."</div></div>

<p>There is also a humorous side to this "mashing"
business. Men and boys who run after actresses generally
get themselves into trouble, particularly is this
the case with old men&mdash;men old enough to be thinking
of the designs for their tombstones instead of
running around variety theatres hugging girls and lavishing
champagne and beer upon them. An old sinner
of this stamp got into trouble in a New York theatre
one day. He made himself conspicuous and obnoxious
at a rehearsal by stumbling over the stage and getting
in everybody's way. The supes cursed him and the
stage carpenter called down anathemas on his aged
head, but the old fellow was indifferent, for he was
basking in the smiles of a well-known soubrette and
was happy. Finally he posed in the centre of the stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
just as an "interior" was to be set. The scene shifters
saw he was in a good position to be squeezed, and they
quietly shoved the scenes together. The lover, intent
on his inamorata, discovered his predicament only when
caught, but the scene shifters were deaf to his cries,
and he was held a prisoner. He was only released on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
swearing never again to poke his nose inside the stage-door,
and furnishing enough to treat the boys. When
at last he was free, he made hasty tracks for the exit,
and was heard to mutter as he went out, he'd be d&mdash;d
if he wanted to be squeezed again, even by his charming
soubrette.</p>

<p>The bald-headed men, though, get it worse than anybody
else, and particularly so when their bald heads
are hidden under wigs. A monkey had a part to play
in a piece running at one of the metropolitan variety
theatres. There was a pretty burlesque actress playing
there at the same time and she had a host of admirers
with more money than brains. Among the number
was an addle-pated old rascal, who preferred the
society of the "artiste" to that of his aged wife, who
had lost the charms which enraptured his fancy when
he led her years ago as a blushing bride to the altar.
One evening the fellow bribed the door-keeper at the
stage entrance to admit him to that realm of dirt, paint,
and faded tinsel "behind the scenes," and he stationed
himself in the wings in order to welcome his charmer
when she retired amid the plaudits of the audience.
But alas, the "best laid plans of mice and men gang
aft aglee." The monkey espied him, and at once fell
in love with the glossy wig which covered the bald
head. Swinging itself down from the flies the monkey
made a swoop with its long arm and the masher was
scalped. He cried lustily, but the monkey made off
with its trophy and the masher sloped with a handkerchief
tied over his head.</p>

<p class="notbold smaller"><i>See</i> p. <a href="#Page_296">296</a>.</p></div></div>

<p>Almost similar was the fate of a bewigged Parisian
who was loafing and "mashing" behind the scenes of
the Grand Opera. A dancer stood in the wings listening
to the prattle of a silly old man. He was protesting
heartily his love for the young lady, and was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
the point of kissing her hand, when, as he stooped
down, she snatched his wig from his head. At that
moment she had to appear on the stage, and did so
amid laughter and applause; for she carried with her
the old fellow's scalp as if by way of trophy. The
applause was less loud, but much more humorous on
the stage; for the gay old lover and his bald head had
to stand a deal of quizzing from those who, like himself,
were in the wings waiting for their "little dears"
to return.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of garden theatres for the
summer months, in nearly all the large cities of the
Union, the "masher" finds ample field for the kind of
sport he indulges in. A girl in red tights created a great
commotion among the swell mashers who frequented
Uhrig's Cave, St. Louis, during the summer of 1881,
and in that connection there could have been revelations
that would carry grief into a few homes and bring
disgrace upon not young and irresponsible men, but
upon prominent citizens who were foolish enough to be
fascinated by the crimson symmetricals. The fraternity
have a peculiar way of working a summer garden.
The phalanx of mashers begin operations early in the
evening. They get to the garden before the lamps are
lit, and dust some of the chairs with their coat-tails and
pantaloons. They watch the singers as they enter and
endeavor to catch some suggestion from them that a
mash has been effected. Now and then a soft, gazelle-like
glance or a sweet, girlish simper, like the smile on
a sick monkey's under lip, gives a token of slight
recognition, and then the masher's heart and eye are
full of gladness. When the curtain is rung up and the
glare turned on, the "mashers" move in a body
towards the front of the stage and dust some more of
the chairs. Then they fix their eyes like so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
lances upon the girls and again attempt to impale
hearts. After the performance they move in a double
line to the side aisle of the garden, and, opening
ranks, wait for the actresses to come out. When
the actresses do come out they are
obliged to run a gauntlet that would
put any but a cast-iron woman
with a heavy veil on to the reddest
blush. Sometimes a "masher"
accomplishes his aim in life and captures
a girl, but it is seldom. The
professional poser has too wide a
reputation and his figure is as clear
a "give-away" as the cigar-sign
Indian's, so that a reputable young
lady who cares anything about continuing
to be respected and esteemed
by her friends is obdurate to
the glances, the moustache, the
smiles, the white hat, light pantaloons,
bamboo canes, and cheap
button-hole <span class="locked">bouquets&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="subhead">THE MAIDEN AND THE TENOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Troubadour Ambleleg was a tenor. He waved
his light voice for a light salary in the chorus of an
unexpensive opera company that made the summer
months of 1881 and the opera air of the West End of
St. Louis melodious to a sometimes quite harassing
degree. His soul was as full of art as his throat was
of music. He doted upon the beautiful wherever he
came in contact with it, and frequently, when he heard
of beauty lying around in languid looseness in any
direction, he went out of his way to find it. It was in
this manner he became acquainted with Miss Silica
Justaytine. She was the belle of an upperly upper
circle, a glowing, brown-eyed maiden, with sun-kissed
hair, and the sweetest smiles that ever played in Polar-light
style over the ruffs and ruchings of an expensive
toilet. Indeed, an aurora borealis of glinting good
nature shone upon the horizon of her lips, and a
single glance of her eye was worth more to a man in
love than the advent of a sprinkling cart to a traveller
perishing of thirst on a dry and burning desert.
When Mr. Ambleleg saw Miss Justaytine, that pink of
beauty and perfection of belleship, gracing a front
bench, where the susceptible tenor was nightly airing
his voice at a salary of ten dollars a week, their eyes
met and their loves at once intertwined. Like Tecetl,
the daughter of Montezuma, who found in the yellow-haired
warrior, Alvarado, the lover she had dreamt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
long before the prow of the "fair god's" vessel
touched the shores of Mexico, the super-æsthetical
maiden of my story saw in the chorus singer the
affinity for which she had long looked and sighed.
Mr. Ambleleg, too, at once became aware that in Miss
Justaytine he had met his fate. They smiled, and
sighed, and ogled, and encouraged each other across
the foot-lights. The chorus singer forgot all the other
maiden beauty that flourished under the foliage, and
there were crushed and trampled hearts lying in the
chasm across which Ambleleg and Miss Justaytine exchanged
their affections. But Ambleleg did not mind
it. He had learned that Miss Justaytine was the queen
of her circle, and he determined to share her crown
with her. Now, Ambleleg was not wealthy; neither
was he rich in prepossessing features. His teeth were
freckled, his mouth was big, his forehead small, his
eyes expressionless, his hair of a buttery yellow, his
moustache vapid, his shirt calico, and usually required
to do long service without washing, while his general
appearance was not extravagantly pleasant, and certainly
not over-abundant in that grace and ease for
which pretty girls have, at all times, a fondness.
Therefore, it was surprising that Miss Silica Justaytine
fell in love with the chorus-singing tenor. But she
did so, and, it seems, fell so deeply into admiration of
himself and his voice, that she could not have done
better had she made the start, in falling, from the top
of a seven-story house. When love is once kindled in
the glow of a pair of admiring eyes, look out for a
conflagration in the neighborhood of the pericardium.
Night after night, as the moon washed the tree tops
with waves of silver, and the leaves rustled their whispers
to each other, Miss Silica Justaytine sat in the
front row, either joining with the chorus of æsthetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
maidens in "Patience" in singing to her own ideal
<i>Bunthorne</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Turn, oh turn in this direction,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shed, oh shed a gentle smile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a glance of sad perfection<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My poor fainting heart beguile!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On such eyes as maidens cherish<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or incontinently perish<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In their all-consuming rays.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Or following <i>Bettina</i> through the mazes of the
"Mascotte" gobble song, while she had a <i>Pippo</i> of
her own in mind all the time. Ambleleg noticed this
growing affection, and sang all the louder, and all the
wilder, to the great endangerment of the performances.
At last Miss Silica Justaytine left him a token of her
love&mdash;a soft, white rose, which she kissed and placed
in her chair as she departed one evening. Ambleleg
cleared the stage at a bound, secured the creamy
flower, pressed it to his lips and over his calico shirt
bosom, after which he carefully stowed it away in a
pocket-book with his wash and board-bills. The following
day Miss Silica Justaytine was toying with a
$10,000 necklace in the bay window of her palatial residence
on Pinafore Avenue, when the postman handed
her a letter in a yellow envelope. It was from Ambleleg.
She blushed as she looked at it, then opened and
read it, smiled and floated gracefully up to an escritoire,
where she indited a charming little note on pink monogram
paper with heavy gold edges, and placed it in one
of the nattiest and most scrumptious envelopes you ever
saw. Ambleleg read that note that very night to a
group of wide-eyed and open-mouthed chorus singers.
It invited him to call on Miss Justaytine the next day.
The call was made. Miss Silica Justaytine received
Ambleleg at the front door, and led him to the magnificent
parlor as graciously as if he were a prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
"My <i>Pippo</i>!" she cried, as she flung her arms
around his neck, and almost knocked over the piano
stool.</p>

<p>"My <i>Bettina</i>!" sighed the tenor, as he pressed her
to his glowing bosom.</p>

<p>After the first agony of meeting they sat down and
told the stories of their love. Cruel fate had dealt
harshly with both. One was already engaged to be
married; the other would not begin to have a ghost
of a show at monogamy if wives were to be had at ten
cents a dozen. Miss Justaytine was betrothed to Mr.
Praymore, a young man who had hopes of coming into
a fortune some day or other, providing he survived
the parent who accumulated it. Mr. Ambleleg was
impecunious; still she said she could scrape up enough
to buy him a suit of clothes and a box of tooth-powder,
and then they might fly together as far as East St.
Louis anyhow. Miss Justaytine was to become a wandering
minstrel's bride. She took the $5,000 diamond
engagement ring Mr. Praymore had given her, from
her finger, and put on a $2 imitation amethyst that
the chorus singer gave her. What simple, pure, and
unselfish love.</p>

<p>But the course of true love is as rough as the rocky
roads in Dublin. Not content with wandering under
his inamorata's window every night wasting his breath
in whistling Sullivan's music to pieces, while <i>Bettina</i>
opened the shutters of the third-story window and
softly <span class="locked">sang,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For I mi-hy turkey's love,<br /></span>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I my shee-eep love.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">After which there was a mixture of "gobble, gobble,
gobble," and "ba-a-a-ahs." Not content with this
innocent and artistic way of amusing himself while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
kept people awake for blocks around, Ambleleg very
indiscreetly boasted of his success, and exhibited Miss
Silica Justaytine's notes and photographs to indiscriminate
crowds. One day he met Mr. Praymore and a
prize-fighting brother of Miss Justaytine in the street.
This brother had done yoeman's service in the 24-foot
ring, and required but slight provocation to
disturb the claret in a nose so inviting as that which
decorated the middle of Mr. Ambleleg's face. By the
free use of whiskey punches these young men finally
inveigled Ambleleg into a deep and dark cellar where
they proceeded to touch him up with fists and feet
that he might not be able to identify himself again.
After materially spoiling his appearance, they made
themselves presents of the photographs and letters
which they found in his possession, gave him a few
parting touches, and then went away to prepare an
official statement of their side of the case. Ambleleg
now had no more use for the Justaytine mansion, or
the Justaytine beauty, so he made up his mind to heal
his heart and his bruises with a $10,000 balm. For
this purpose he went into court. Miss Silica had
winged herself away to the Rosebud Sulphur Springs,
and was not aware of the fame herself and her chorus
singer were achieving at home. Ambleleg hired him
two lawyers to plead his cause, and then there was a
great uproar all over the country. The papers busied
themselves about the matter very much, and impudently
published all the details that they could get
hold of. Quite natural it was that when Miss Silica
Justaytine arrived at the Rosebud Sulphur Springs,
the fashionable and celebrated beauties there should
be so jealous of her triumph over a chorus singer, that
they were sparing of their attentions and cutting in
their remarks. Some of the same envious ones had had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
food for gossip a season or two before over Miss Silica
Justaytine's capture of a $15,000,000 ex-Presidential
candidate. That a woman should range all the way
from a Presidential candidate to a chorus singer, was
unusual and interesting. So unpleasant did the gossiping
souls at Rosebud Sulphur Springs make it for
Miss Silica Justaytine, that she hastened back to the
more congenial atmosphere of her home on Pinafore
Avenue. In the meantime, her prize-fighting brother
and Mr. Praymore had, with the same courage that
impelled them to decoy Mr. Ambleleg into a cellar,
and beat him, and draw a Gatling gun on him, fallen
down on their knees before Miss Silica Justaytine and
asked her to plead their cause. She consented, and by
a swift-footed courier sent Ambleleg a message accompanied
by the talismanic words, "<i>Pippo</i>" and
"Amethyst." He stopped smoking a five-cent cigar
and rushed out to the Justaytine mansion like a fire-engine
pursued by an insurance man. His lawyer
seized his coat-tail and followed, the two arriving
there out of breath, the one bent on money, the other
called by the sweet voice of love.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Pippo</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Bettina</i>!"</p>

<p>This was the salutation that fell from the two lovers
as their eyes melted into each other.</p>

<p>"<i>Pippo</i>, you have sued my prize-fighting brother
and my ostensible lover for $10,000. They are short
of cash just now and cannot conveniently pay. Please
cut down the amount just a little bit, dear <i>Pippo</i>.
For the sake of this amethyst (shows him the ring) I
beg of you cut it down," said she.</p>

<p>"I'll cut it down, <i>Bettina</i>," he said, "but I do it
only for your sweet dear sake."</p>

<p>"How much?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
"All I want," he answered, "is enough to buy a
silver watch, a new suit of clothes, pay my board and
wash bill, get me three cigars for ten cents, and take
me home to my mother. I think I can get along with
$500."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" the charming and delighted creature
inquired.</p>

<p>"Not quite all," put in Ambleleg; "the two lawyers
I have hired cannot be assuaged with less than
$500. We three&mdash;that is, the two lawyers and myself&mdash;want
$500 apiece. Thus you see I cut the
$10,000 down $8,500," and he jammed his thumbs
into the arm-holes of his vest and assumed the attitude
of a man who could lose that amount in a game of
poker every day in the week and never feel the loss.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Pippo</i>, you are so good to reduce so liberally,"
said Miss Justaytine, and she threw her arms
around his neck and kissed him in a wild and irresponsible
way.</p>

<p>Thus the interview ended, and as Ambleleg ambled
down the front steps Miss Silica Justaytine sat down
at her piano, ecstatically thrummed it and enthusiastically
<span class="locked">sang:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The lawyers subsequently fixed the matter up among
themselves, and Ambleleg, after getting a few dollars

he still had a good chorus voice and was helping to

<p>The merchant who has anything to dispose of advertises
it, and the most successful men in any line of
business are those who are most liberal in the use
of printers' ink. The theatrical fraternity thoroughly
understand this, and their first and foremost idea in
everything they do is to get themselves before the
public, and, if possible, keep themselves there. Their
appreciation of the value of a puff or notice is beautifully
set forth in the following funny paragraph which
I found floating around in the <span class="locked">newspapers:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"A Leadville paper stated that a well-known actress
who visited that city went to a saloon after a performance,
played poker, got drunk, licked the bartender,
and cleaned out the crowd. Of course she was
very indignant and was going to cowhide the editor,
when the amazed journalist explained to her that it
was a first-class puff that would get her an opening in
society in Leadville. And then she thanked him and
gave him a dozen passes."</p>

  <div class="caption">SERVING A WRIT ON FANNY DAVENPORT.</div></div>

<p>Some actors, and some actresses, too, do not care
a cent what the means employed are or what the
printed matter is, so the names are their own and once
more they are before the people. The great majority,
however, while anxious to appear in print as often and
in as many columns as a paper can spare without
throwing out paying advertisements, are very scrupulous
about the character of the statements credited to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>them or actions spoken of, while all affect to be utterly
independent of the press and to have no regard whatever
for the good it can do them, or the harm either.
If they meant what they said they might be set down
as foolish; but they do not mean anything of the
kind, and the fact that day after day the most outrageous
stories about professional people go uncontroverted,
is an indication that not only are they
willing to have such things published, but may have
instigated them themselves.</p>

<p>The only kind of newspaper notice a Thespian might
not court, but which, once printed, would be looked
upon philosophically as so much printers' ink obtained
for nothing&mdash;so much advertising had that wasn't
paid for&mdash;is such a one as the announcement of the
attempt of a sheriff to lasso Miss Fanny Davenport,
in order that he might be able to hold her long
enough to read a writ of some sort to her.</p>

<p>Different actors and actresses have different ways of
advertising themselves. The interview is a favorite
with some, and often the interview is so arranged that
the player can appear before the newspaper man in
some eccentric attitude that will attract more attention
than all the player could say if he talked for one hundred
years. Harry Sargent likes a reporter to see
Modjeska, and as the visitor enters he finds the Polish
actress firing across the room with a pistol at a small
target, which she manages to hit every time. Displaying
diamonds is another scheme to catch the unwary
newspaper man. Sending along photographs is
expected to throw an editor into an ecstasy of liberality
out of which he will come with at least a half-column
puff of the pretty creature whose counterpart
presentment has been sent to him. Diamond robberies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
are worth at least a column. Falling heir to $5,000,000
or more will bring an interview that will be worth
almost as much as the legacy. In everything an
actor or an actress says and does the newspaper will
find something worth printing, and in printing it the
paper does exactly what the actor or actress wants&mdash;places
him or her before the public. Mme. Janauschek
gets a slight jolt in going down the shaft of a Colorado
mine, and the country is immediately informed that
she has had a narrow escape from death. Minnie
Maddern, a new star who expects to rival Lotta, is
made a brevet officer of the Continental Guards of
New Orleans, and her manager feels assured that the
people of the United States would not sleep well if
they didn't hear about it within twenty-four hours, so
he gets the Associated Press to telegraph it in all directions,
that at least a few lives may be saved. A Bohemian
prince presents Emma Thursby, at Prague,
with a pair of nightingales, and about ten lines of
every newspaper this side of the Atlantic are wasted
in making the silly announcement. The souvenir and
flower "rackets" both carry a certain weight, and the
lithograph that fills the eye as one gazes into a shoe
store window is a glory that can never fade from the
optic that has even for a second of time dwelt upon it.</p>

<p>Minnie Palmer, if all reports be true, came to the
front some time ago with a new bid for a free advertisement.
She entertained a Louisville <i>Courier-Journal</i>
reporter with a display that must have made the
young man blush. "Our company has got into the
chemise fever," exclaimed Minnie, artlessly, "and
we're trying to see which can make the prettiest one.
I'll show them to you," and then, regardless of the
helpless man's blushes, she disemboweled a trunk and
buried him beneath an avalanche of snowy underwear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Their construction was minutely explained, and then
the conversation naturally led to flannels, which Minnie
confidentially remarked could not be worn by
actors because of the risk of colds when compelled to
leave them off. The theme could scarcely be pursued
further than flannels, and the interview closed with
Minnie's confession that she didn't like to be hugged
on the stage in warm weather. In winter, and unencumbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
by flannels, the operation was not so distasteful.
All of this may seem irrelevant, and having
very little to do with dramatic art, but it made a column
for Minnie all the same.</p>

<p>The Abbott Kiss, invented by John T. McEnnis, a
reporter on the St. Louis <i>Post-Dispatch</i>, but always
claimed by Jimmy Morrissey, who was her agent at
the time, traveled everywhere and was printed in
every newspaper from New York to San Francisco.
It had just about played out when in 1881, during the
prevalence of small-pox, Miss Abbott had herself vaccinated
on one of her lower limbs, and again the papers
advertised her. She afterwards acted in the capacity
of interviewer for the St. Louis <i>Globe-Democrat</i>, and
was commissioned to get a talk out of Patti, but spent
all the time she was with the diva in kissing and hugging
her, and when she came away from her had nothing
to write about. Still Miss Abbott is a hard-working,
gifted, and agreeable little lady, and must be
regarded as the best lyric prima donna America can
boast of.</p>

<p>Speaking about Patti: she came to the United States
under foreign management, and with all her sweetness
and beauty of voice and the greatness of her reputation,
she could do nothing until an American manager
who understood the art of advertising took hold of
her. He began his work at once by decorating his
theatre in lavish style for her first concert, and completed
his initial triumph by causing a crowd of
young fellows to unhitch the horses from Patti's carriage
and run with the vehicle through the streets to
her hotel. The report next day said the amateur
horses were society swells, and so the news went into
every State of the Union. Neilson's carriage was
dragged through the street in the same way once at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
Toronto. Patti got another free "ad." by visiting
Paddy Ryan, the pugilist John Sullivan knocked out
of time, in his training quarters at New Orleans, just
as Bernhardt went to see Englehardt's whale at Boston
for the sake of the advertisement she got.</p>

<p>Just as Schneider kicked herself into the good graces
of the Parisians, Catherine Lewis, of "Olivette" fame,
managed to "fling" herself into popularity here. The
Lewis fling in the farandole was known and sought
after everywhere. It was a wild and wayward tossing
of limbs and arms that caught the eye and held the
attention not so much because there was anything
artistic in it, but because one expected every minute
to see it grow less and less restrained until it broke
out into something like the reckless indecency of the
cancan. It advertised Catherine Lewis as she has not
been advertised since, and as she probably never will
be again. As the "fling" is not dead yet I will try
to describe it. After the solo and while the first chorus
is being given she moves back with the other dancers,
throwing her arms from right to left and left to right
again, when the dancers came to a standstill. <i>Olivette</i>
is seen posing in a lop-sided, Pisa-like attitude, with
both arms and head inclining to the left. The chorus
is repeated, and as the repetition begins the dancers
turn themselves loose with <i>Olivette</i> in the van.
"Oho" she sings and swings to the left; "Oho" to
the right, "Oho" to the left again, when out pops
the left slipper, followed swiftly by the right ditto, and
the toe of the latter foot-covering tumbles over the
horizon of the orchestra leader's head, and there is a
confusion of embroidery and white linen and silk hose
that fills the eye of the man in the parquette with a
flash of joy and causes a warm still wind to roll in a
breezeful way around his cardiacal region. "Oho,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
"Oho" and "Oho" again, with more body throwing,
and this time the elevation of the toe of the left
slipper above the line of vision, just a little higher than
before, followed by three more "Oho's," and the
quivering of the satin slipper on the right foot high
over the foot-lights and in close range to the man with
field glasses to his eyes who is sitting in the first row
of the parquette. And that's all there is to the farandole&mdash;nine
swings or throws of the body and three
kicks every time she comes down the stage, the altitude
of the kick growing with each succeeding effort
until the last spasmodic, ærial evolution of the satin
slipper brings about a display of linen that would do
credit to the lingerie counter of a dry goods store.
<i>Olivette</i> has the attention of the entire audience while
this is going on. She goes up and comes down the
stage twice, swinging and kicking with an anatomical
riot behind her, every female member of the company
from the chorus girl up to the <i>Countess</i> vying with
<i>Olivette</i> in sending the farandole off with a hurrah and
multiplicity of "flings." When the chorus has come
to an end, there is a bold encore for its repetition, and
away they go again.</p>

<p>Miss Lewis at one time while in New York was freely

<p>Maggie Duggan, a young lady until recently comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
unknown, has suddenly made herself famous by
nightly kicking her slipper to the top of the Bijou

<p>Emilie Melville, an operatic star of California, in looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
over her stock of presents could think of nothing
more suitable or anything that would prove more
acceptable to the dramatic critics of San Francisco and
her friends than to give each one of her slippers. So
she held a reception; and, dressed in Oriental toilet,
she presented each as he came with one of the tiny
silken slippers in which her tootsies used to slumber on
the stage. It was such a novel proceeding that Miss
Melville got more gratuitous puffing than she could have
paid for with the profits of one of her best seasons.</p>

<p>Henry Mapleson, whom I know has no fear of the
newspaper man, but rather courts his society and wooes
the columns of his paper, made the following ridiculous
statement (to a reporter) concerning the manner in
which he and his wife, Marie Roze, were pestered by
reporters on the road: "They began early in the
morning. When I first opened my bed-room door I
was sure to find one or two outside of it. No detail
was too small for them. They would follow us around
and give scraps of our conversation, and one fellow
even sat at the same dinner-table with us in Kansas
City and printed a list of all the things my wife ate,
making it about five times as long as the truth called
for, and adding such trifles as four oranges, six pieces
of cake, etc. My wife was so angry when this account
appeared in the afternoon paper that we determined to
have our supper in our room, and, as the landlord would
not consent to that, I bought a steak during the evening,
and Marie Roze, still dressed as <i>Helen of Troy</i>,
began to cook it over a spirit lamp. We were congratulating
ourselves that no reporter would know anything
about that supper, when a knock was given on
the door. 'Who's there?' I called out. The answer
came back through the keyhole: 'I am a reporter of
the <i>Morning Buzzard</i>, and I want to know what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
had for supper. That <i>Evening Crow</i> fellow got ahead
of me on the dinner, but I'll fetch him on the supper.'"</p>

<p>A story that illustrates, in an exaggerated way,
though, the tricks of the dramatic profession, is told of
a shrewd agent who found himself in Mansfield, Ohio,
with a company on his hands and pursued by bad
business so relentlessly that he began to have doubts
that he would ever see Union Square again. In this
strait he called his never-failing wits to his aid and
devised a plan straightway that led him out of the difficulty,
as had happened to him many a time before. He
went to the room of his star&mdash;his leading lady&mdash;and
knocked. He was admitted. "Why, Sam," said
she, "what do you want at this hour?"</p>

<p>"I want your ear," said he.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all," said the leading lady, recovering
from her pallor; "I thought&mdash;but no matter; go on."</p>

<p>"You know business is bad," said he.</p>

<p>"Well, I should smile," said the artiste; "since I
haven't had any salary for four weeks. What's the
new racket."</p>

<p>"It's this," said the agent: "If we expect to go out
of this town we've got to do something Napoleonic.
And you've got to do it."</p>

<p>"You forget my sex," said she.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said he; "there may be a Napoleon
in petticoats as well as in trousers."</p>

<p>"Very well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"I want to get a column in each of the daily
papers."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you'll want it, for all the newspaper
boys know we've got a snide show this time," she
said.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess not, if you'll do what I tell you,"
said the artful agent.</p>

<p>"What is that?" inquired the guileless actress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
"You know the railroad bridge outside of town?"</p>

<p>"That shaky old wooden structure of patched logs
and sleepers?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>"That bridge will get us columns in every paper for
forty miles around."</p>

<p>"You've got 'em, Sam, sure."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. I'm solid on the biz. Now listen:
I want you to go to-morrow and stand in the middle
of that bridge when the two 2:20 trains pass each
other going in opposite directions."</p>

<p>"Well, you are fresh. What'll I do that for?"</p>

<p>"For an 'ad.'"</p>

<p>"And where will I be when the trains pass?"</p>

<p>"Why, if you're smart and listen to me, you'll be
clinging to the trestle-work underneath until they pass
over you, then I'll head on back to the hotel and have
all the reporters come up and interview you, and then
there will be columns published, the house will be
filled that night and we will rake in a heavy stake."</p>

<p>The actress saw the point and had the pluck to execute
the project of the agent. She stood on the bridge
at the appointed time. She shrieked in the most
frantic manner. The engineer reversed the engine and
whistled down brakes, but in spite of all the train
passed over her. There was a great sensation. She
was dragged out from the trestle-work and taken to
the hotel. The papers which would not take the
advertisement of the show because the manager could
not pay in advance sent reporters to interview the
actress on her narrow escape, and gave columns to the
company. The result was a series of full houses and
the "snides" made a triumphant march eastward
on the impetus of the shrewd agent's "gag."</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ACTRESS AND THE INTERVIEWER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In no other country in the world does the interviewer's
profession thrive as in these United States.
From the cabinet minister&mdash;nay, the President himself&mdash;down
to the common felon, all at different times
are liable to what is called "the pressure of the pumping
process." Some classes naturally like being
interviewed, because all publicity adds to their importance
and notoriety. The politicians are a specimen of
this species. Then, again, another class regards the
interview as a legitimate means of advertising and
of attracting public attention to themselves and their
doings. This class specially includes the dramatic profession.
An enterprising manager is always ready to
introduce his star to a journalist. Actresses and prima
donne are to a great degree public personages, and
there is an insatiable desire on the part of individuals
to learn something of the foot-light favorites when they
have doffed the stage costume, rubbed off the paint and
powder, and become, as it were, for the time being an
ordinary mortal. Hence, the newspapers have catered
to this popular inquisitiveness, and there is scarcely an
actress or sweet singer of note who has not passed the
ordeal of the interviewing fiend. Mr. Henry W.
Moore, city editor and dramatic critic of the St. Louis
<i>Post-Dispatch</i>, who has done as much interviewing in
this line as any newspaper man in the Western country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
thus records his impressions of the operatic and
dramatic celebrities whom he has <span class="locked">met:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Adelina Patti, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">casta diva</i>, always receives the
journalist attired in handsome toilettes. Her marriage
with the Marquis de Caux rendered her aristocratic in
manners, and her behavior always has in it a tinge of
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse oblige</i>. There is an almost imperceptible
flavor of condescension in her tone, which, while
courteous, is rather formal. Since her separation from
De Caux, La Marquise has become more accessible,
and both she and Nicolini are almost warm in their
effusions to journalists.</p>

<p>Christine Nilsson receives the interviewer pleasantly,
but rather dignified in manner. She is somewhat cold
in conversation, but her manners are always courteous.
She talks little.</p>

<p>Etelka Gerster likes the interviewer. At first she
regarded him as an American curiosity, but having
learned his value she began to caress him. Gerster is
not at all so sweet in private life as is generally believed.
The Hungarian prima donna is very passionate
and quick-tempered, and rules her husband, Dr.
Gardine, with her whims. In the presence of the
journalist she conceals her claws beneath her velvety
hand and is sweetness itself. She talks much, dotes
on America and the American people, and all that sort
of gush. Her dresses are not particularly artistic,
conveying the impression that she is slovenly in this
regard.</p>

<p>Clara Kellogg submits to an interview as if it were
a regular business transaction. Her mother is always
present and will frequently make suggestions. Miss
Kellogg chats pleasantly, but she has no warmth in her
manner and no magnetism in her conversation.</p>

<p>Annie Louise Cary is what the journalists term a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
"jolly" girl. She does not care a whit what she says
or does. She will laugh and chat as if the interviewer
were an old acquaintance. She greets him with a spontaneous
warmth and familiarity which are pleasant to
him. He may ask the most inquisitive questions and
she will reply with a shrewd smile. Amiable, good-tempered
and lively in disposition, she is a great
favorite with newspaper men.</p>

<p>Minnie Hauk is impetuosity personified. Minnie
usually has a grievance against her manager, and she
will pour her woes into the journalist's ears with remarkable
loquacity. But Minnie has a mother. After
the interviewer is gone Minnie will send him a note or
a messenger requesting him in Heaven's name not to
publish what she said or she would be undone. Yet,
the next time Minnie meets a night of the quill she
reiterates her woes and wrongs with the same impetuosity.
She is frank to a fault, and confides a good deal in
human nature. Her frankness has involved her several
times in trouble. She is very apt to become unreasonably
jealous of any other prima donna in the troupe,
and thus always keeps the impresario in a state of
nervousness.</p>

<p>Emma Abbott is the gusher <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">par excellence</i>. At the
first glance of the interviewer she rushes towards him,
seizes him with both her hands, is Oh, so, so glad to
see him! She talks with great rapidity and unceasingly.
The scribe to her is an old familiar friend.
She insists on his calling on her, dining with her, etc.,
etc. Her friendliness is overwhelming. She loads the
journalist with favors, and almost embraces him in the
ardor of her affection.</p>

<p>Sarah Bernhardt has all the French warmth and
demonstrativeness. She is witty and vivacious in her
conversation, really likes journalists, and will spend a
whole day with them. She never tires, and is a study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
to the newspaper man. She is, however, not insensible
to flattery. Her curiosity about things American
is very keen. Being a delightful entertainer, she was
very popular with the journalistic profession. She is
fond of inviting them to breakfast.</p>

<p>Clara Morris is an excellent subject for an interview.
Miss Morris always prepares to receive the representative
of the press in some picturesque attitude or pose.
She has a fine perception of artistic effect, and never
loses sight of the fact that it is an interview, and hence
has an eye to what will appear in print. In her discourse
she aims to be epigrammatic and witty; likes
to be novel and original. Her knowledge is very
varied, and she converses with ease and fluency. Her
face sparkles, and her reception is always extremely
cordial.</p>

<p>Modjeska, otherwise the Countess Bozenta, is, perhaps,
the best educated actress on the stage. She is a
gifted linguist, well read in French, German, and English
literature. She is a charming conversationalist.
In manners she is a perfect lady, without any stage
eccentricities. She is a delightful hostess, and dispenses
hospitality most gracefully. Her bearing is
courteous but thoroughly friendly, and there is the
impress of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la grande dame</i> in her demeanor. She is
partial to canine pets.</p>

<p>Adelaide Neilson captured every journalist who ever
interviewed her. She seemed to bend all her energies
to captivate her visitor. Her remarkable beauty was
a powerful aid, and the charm of her manner was irresistible.
When necessary, she was almost a man of
business, and transacted her affairs with much ability.
Poor Adelaide was too potent a spell for ordinary interviewers
to withstand, and she always carried her
point.</p>

<p>Mary Anderson is a great talker. Her mother and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
step-father, Dr. Hamilton Griffin, are usually in attendance
at an interview. She is decided in her opinions,
and expresses her views fearlessly, but her
remarks are superficial. She is lively and a regular
tom-boy, and hesitates at nothing.</p>

<p>Fanny Davenport, who is noted for her expensive
costumes on the stage, is the reverse in private life.
She is nearly always in a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">neglige</i> attire and looks somewhat
slovenly. Fanny is rather averse to the interviewer,
but when she submits she is as charming and
pleasant a hostess as can be imagined. But nevertheless
she thinks it a decided bore to entertain.</p>

<p>Maggie Mitchell is a whole-souled, generous woman,
without a spark of affectation. She is frank, pleasant,
and amiable.</p>

<p>Lotta, vivacious Lotta, is very demure in the presence
of her mother and the journalist. She is quite
unlike the Lotta of the stage. Mrs. Crabtree joins in
the conversation, which Lotta carries on in a very subdued
but friendly manner.</p>

<p>Janauschek is firm, solid, and determined in her
convictions. She has strong likes and dislikes. She
talks with much emphasis.</p>

<p>Mrs. D.&nbsp;P. Bowers is a pleasant lady to visit. She
is quite motherly in her manners. Her conversation
contains much shrewd, caustic depth.</p>

<p>Charlotte Thompson is intellectual. She possesses
what the French call <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit</i> and her conversation is
always enjoyable.</p>

<p>Emma Thursby is an interesting lady. The queen
of the concert-room is vivacious, lively, and talkative.
She is exceedingly fond of representatives of the press.</p>

<p>Marie Roze is only an indifferent entertainer. She
is very fond of pet dogs. The effort is always visible
in her conversation, and the visitor feels that she believes
she is merely doing a necessary duty.</p>

<span class="subhead">A FEW FOOT-LIGHT FAVORITES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Little Peggy, afterwards the famous Mistress Woffington,
was down at the shores of Liffey drawing
water for her mother, when Madame Violante, a rope-walker,
met her, and taking a liking to the girl, made
terms with the parents and obtained possession of her.
Madame Violante walked the rope with a child tied to
her feet, and lovely little Peggy for a while assisted in
this way at her mistress's entertainments. When the
Madame got to Dublin she found a juvenile company
playing "Cinderella" there, and at once began the
organization of a class of children, who appeared in
the play with Peggy as one of the bright luminaries.
This was her introduction to the stage, which she trod
with such brilliant success in after years. Nor was
she the only one of the famous old English actresses
trained to the drama from childhood. All through
the history of theatricals, from and before Woffington's
time, children were made participants in the
play, and the seeds planted thus early ripened into
the richest fruit. Until a very recent date it was not
deemed the duty of anybody to interfere with this
kind of training&mdash;not even with the barbarous treatment
to which children training for the circus ring
were submitted. Less than a half century ago the
Viennese children went through the country dancing,
and were unmolested by any philanthropically inclined
body or any excessively humane individual. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>juvenile "Pinafore" companies of two seasons ago
were regarded kindly by press and public; and, indeed,
until quite recently no extraordinary war was
made against presenting the talents of a child actor or
actress to the people. The Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children has, however, organized a
stubborn resistance to the employment of little ones
in stage representations; and while it may be well to
exercise some authority for the protection of infants
and for the preservation of the stage from a deluge
of child-talent, there can be no justification in allowing
that authority to run riot in plucking every blossom
from the tree of histrionism, and erecting a permanent
barrier against the development of native talent, when
any happens to exist in a child of tender years. The
experience of more than two centuries shows that the
best training is that which begins earliest, which begins
slowly, and widens only with the slow progress of the
years. There are very few actors or actresses who
have walked out of private life into the glare of the
foot-lights with anything like success. The amateur
may sometimes be suddenly metamorphosed into a
full-fledged professional, with a bit of reputation to
help him along the road he has chosen to travel, but
this happens very rarely. Only those who begin early
and study hard, and who have often to wait a long
time for recognition, gain a place in the Thespian
temple, and it is to those whose infant eyes open
almost upon the mysteries and wonders of the mimic
world, whose little limbs grow to strength behind the
scenes, and whose lives are identified completely with
all that have place or being behind the foot-lights, that
it is given to hope for position in the profession into
which they have been born instead of kidnapped.</p>

<p>I think the society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>Children did a very good thing when it took Little
Corinne from the stage. The child was overtaxed far
beyond her years; there was nothing very clever about
her any more than there would be about a school-girl
of the same age who had been taught to speak her
piece and did it boldly, but awkwardly and inartistically.
It was more painful than pleasant to sit out a
performance of "Cinderella" with this offspring of
the Kemble family in the role of the heroine of the
glass slipper, and it was a temporary blessing to the
public while the little thing was kept out of the way.
Like all the precocious ventures on the stage, Corinne
will gradually fade from memory, and the only thought
left of her will be a painful recollection of her childish
efforts to please the grown people who were foolish
enough to go to the theatre to see her.</p>

<p>The young man or the young lady who has given
years of study to preparation for the stage finds the
debut night one fraught with fears and hopes. There
are friends behind the scenes and friends in the audience
willing to overlook faults and exaggerate excellencies;
but there are cold, stern critics, too, anxious
to puncture the new candidate for public favor in every
tender spot their cruel eyes can search out, and there
is the great public, that fickle body whose applause or
condemnation often depends upon the whim of the
moment. The effort is an enormous one to the new
player; the suspense, frightful. A whole life's work
may be swept out of sight in a moment, and the life
itself blighted forever. But when the moment of success
arrives&mdash;what a thrill of joy the triumph sends
to the heart of the actress, if actress it be! What a
dream of glory she already begins to live in! How
her brain throbs and her heart bounds, and all the
world seems a paradise, beautiful and fair as Eden was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
when it left the hands of the Creator! Friends crowd
around, the house is ringing with applause, and she
tears away from the congratulations and kisses and
hand-shakings to step out before the curtain, and, with
glowing face and tears in her eyes, kisses her hand and
makes a profoundly thankful obeisance to the audience.
Then she returns to her crowding friends on the stage,
from the manager down to the call-boy and scene-shifters,
and her ears ring with praise and encouraging
words until it is time for the curtain to go up once
more.</p>

<p>The debut of Emma Livry, an artiste who promised
to lead a very brilliant career, but who was suddenly
and early cut down by death, is described in a very interesting
manner by one who was present. It was at
the Grand Opera House, Paris, and the theatre was
filled from parquette to dome with an extraordinary
audience. Louis Napoleon was there, and the Empress
Eugenie; princes and dukes filled the boxes, and the
nobility of France, representative Americans and
prominent Englishmen were in the audience. Emma
Livry was then only sixteen. From her earliest childhood,
says the writer, she had been devoted to the art
of dancing&mdash;though this was no extraordinary thing,
for there are a large number of girls always in training
for the Grand Opera in Paris, who are taken at the age
of four years, and kept in constant practice until they
reach womanhood, when they appear in public. But
this girl had shown extraordinary genius. In her later
years the celebrated dancer, Marie Taglioni, Countess
de Voisius, hearing of the new dancer, left her villa on
the Lake of Como, and her palace in Venice, to come
to Paris to give the girl lessons. Her improvement
was miraculous. Taglioni said she would renew the
triumphs she herself had won in former days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
And now she glided upon the stage. The brilliant
audience ceased their chatter as she appeared. The
occasion took the character of what it was afterwards
called in the newspapers&mdash;"a great solemnity." She
was very young and was just at that period in the life
of a girl when her figure is apt to be what old-fashioned
people call raw-boned. She was tall, thin, and
pale. Her face was not handsome. Her form gave
no evidence of physical strength.</p>

<p>She was received in a hush of silence. "Let us
see," this great audience seemed to say, "what you
really can do in this poetic art." Any one who could
have connected sensuality or grossness with this girl
would have been baser than a sybarite; and yet her
dress was the conventional dress of ballet dancers&mdash;short
to the calf of the leg but thickly clad above.</p>

<p>She began. O Grace, you never found a prototype
till now! O Painting, Sculpture, you paled before this
supple, elastic, firm, yet dainty tread. At the conclusion
of her first movement, when with a gush of sweet
music she sprang like a fawn to the foot-lights, and extending
her slender arms and delicate hands towards
the audience, as if to ask, "Come, what is the verdict
on me now?" a burst of enthusiastic applause,
loud shouts of "Brava!" and "Bravissima!"
"C'est magnifique!" waving of perfumed handkerchiefs,
a deluge of sweet flowers formed the response.</p>

<p>The whole evening was a series of triumphs. The
Emperor and Empress sent an aid-de-camp behind the
scene to offer her the Imperial congratulations. Marie
Taglioni, accompanied by her noble husband, sought
the girl also, and taking from her breast a magnificent
diamond star, which had been given her in former
days by the Emperor of Russia, "Here," said she,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>"take this the queen of dance, Marie Taglioni, is
dead&mdash;long live the queen, Emma Livry!"</p>

  <div class="caption">TAGLIONI CONGRATULATING EMMA LIVRY.</div></div>

<p>As I passed out amongst the dense crowd, the
writer continues, I saw a woman of middle age, and
respectably dressed, leaning against one of the marble
columns in the vestibule. Her face was flushed
and she was wiping tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>"You weep, Madonna?" said a gentleman who was
passing.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur," she replied, "but it is with joy.
Who would not be proud of such a daughter, and of
such a tribute to her genius?"</p>

<p>There are few favorites of the public to-day who
have not fought their way to the front inch by inch,
who have not sacrificed everything for their art, toiling
through the day that the work of the night might
show improvement&mdash;very few who have not served
years of apprenticeship on the stage before the moment
of success arrived. And this has been the rule
always. Nell Gwynne, the fish-girl, whose beauty
and bright repartee attracted the attention of Lacy, the
actor, and who peddled oranges to the audience before
she began to amuse them on the stage, managed without
much trouble, and during a short stage experience,
to win the heart of Charles II., who made her his mistress
and retained her while he lived, his parting
words to those around his death-bed being, "See that
poor Nelly doesn't starve;" but Nelly did starve. She
died in poverty and left a line of dukes to perpetuate
her plebeian blood in royal veins. She died in
November, 1687, in her thirty-seventh year.</p>

<p>Lola Montez, the pretty Irish girl who in her fourteenth
year eloped with one Capt. James to avoid a
disagreeable marriage, accompanied him to India,
where they got mutually tired of each other and returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
to England studied dancing and went on the
stage, was another of those fortunate and unfortunate
fascinating women whose lives fade away fast and
who after a brief hey-day of luxuries lie down in rags
and poverty to seek a needed rest that is never broken.
She won the hearts of kings, led a revolution in
Poland, and finally, after being driven from her Bavarian
castle where, as Countess of Lansfield she had
ruled, and strutting a brief hour in London in male
attire, died in this country January 17, 1861. Her
ashes rest in Greenwood Cemetery, but she was saved
from a pauper's grave only through the charity of
some friend. During her life she had thrown away
millions. Fallin, the husband of Maude Granger, is
the son of the man with whom Lola Montez had her last
escapade, Fallin, Sr., deserting his family in New
York to accompany Lola to San Francisco. Her real
name was Marie Dolores Eliza Rospanna Gilbert.</p>

<p>Another child of genius whom waywardness and
frailty brought to an early grave was Adelaide McCord,
better known to the world as Adah Isaacs Menken.
She was born near New Orleans, June 15, 1835, and
when still young went on the stage as a ballet dancer
in one of the theatres of the Crescent City. She had
been expelled from school, and tiring of her native village,
where she had created a sensation by embracing
the Jewish faith, she made the journey to New Orleans,
and as I have said went on the stage. Her career
there was not a very brilliant one until she began playing
<i>Mazeppa</i>, the part with which her name has since
been identified. Prior to her time men had appeared
in this role. Her first appearance was on Monday
night, June 17, 1861, in the Green Street Theatre,
New York, then under the management of Capt. John
B. Smith. On the first attempt to go up the run the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
horse after making one turn fell, crashing through the
scenery with the Menken on its back. Horse and rider
were picked up, and after some delay the ascent was
made amidst a great deal of enthusiasm. The appearance
of so beautiful a woman as Menken in the scarcity
of clothing that <i>Mazeppa</i> requires created a furore,
and from that time her success was assured. She
fought spiritedly in the combat scene, breaking her
sword and otherwise won the good opinion of her
first audience. Previous to this she had married
Alexander Menken, a musician in Galveston, but
by this time also she had obtained an Indiana
divorce. While in New York she met John C. Heenan,
fresh from his victory over Tom Sayers, and
after a brief courtship married him. Another Indiana
divorce soon dissolved this knot, as it did a third time
in the case of Orpheus C. Kerr (Robt. H. Newell).
All this time her fame was growing. She went to
London, and after setting the English metropolis on
fire with her beauty returned to New York, where she
married James Barclay, a merchant, in whose mansion
she and her friends held such wild orgies that Barclay
was glad when she fled to Paris, where she was stricken
down in the midst of her mad career, in 1868. The
brief but expressive epitaph, "Thou knowest," is
carved upon her tomb.</p>

<p>Mary Anderson, the tragedienne, is the most phenomenal
success of late years. She was born July 28,
1859, in Sacramento, California. Her parents removed
to Louisville when she was one year and a half
old, and there she was educated in the Ursuline Convent.
She had a longing to be an actress from
her earliest years, and all her readings tended in
the direction of the stage. She was taken away from
school at the age of thirteen, to pursue her studies for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
the profession to which she seemed to be so strongly
inclined. At the age of fifteen she went to Cincinnati
to see Charlotte Cushman act. While there she
called on Miss Cushman, who said she could give her
only a five-minute audience. Miss Anderson recited
passages from "Richard III.," Schiller's "Maid of
Orleans," and "Hamlet." She remained with Miss
Cushman three hours, and the great actress had such
confidence in her talents that she told her to study a
few hours each day for a year and then she might go
on the stage. This Miss Anderson did. An accident
of some kind or other left Macauley's Theatre in Louisville
with a Saturday night for which there was no attraction.
Macauley knew Miss Anderson's desire to
go on the stage, and meeting her step-father, Dr.
Hamilton Griffin, in the street, told him the girl, who
was then only sixteen, might have the theatre that
night. Miss Anderson was overjoyed. She chose
<i>Juliet</i> for her debut, got a costume hurriedly together
and after one rehearsal and three days' preparation, appeared
before a large audience, and made a decided
hit. This was on November 27, 1875. Macauley was
so pleased with the debutante that he gave her his first
open week at starring terms. She then went to St.
Louis, in March, 1870, and added greatly to the reputation
she had won in her home city. Mr. John W.
Norton supported her. Ben De Bar sent her to his
New Orleans Theatre, and while in the Crescent City she
was presented, by the citizens, with a check for $500,
and the Washington artillery presented her with a
jewelled badge of the battalion. Returning to Louisville
again she continued her studies through the summer,
began starring the following season, and has been
before the public ever since. She is a young lady of remarkable
personal beauty, intelligent and accomplished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
a hard student, and one of the noblest and
fairest of her sex that ever adorned the stage.</p>

  <div class="caption">LOTTA.</div></div>

<p>Lotta Mignon Crabtree, another of the very successful
women on the stage, and one of the brightest soubrettes
that ever delighted a public, was born at No.
750 Broadway, New York, on November 7, 1847. In
1854 her people removed to California, and Lotta
made her first appearance on a stage at a concert given
at Laport; her second appearance was at Petaluma, in
1858, when she played <i>Gertrude</i> in "The Loan of a
Lover." She starred, they say, for two years as La
Petite Lotta. Before she made her appearance in New
York we hear of her in San Francisco at Burt's New
Idea and Gilbert's Melodeon&mdash;concert saloons&mdash;where
Joe Murphy, Barnard, Cotton, Pest, Burbank,
Billy Sheppard, Backus and other prominent minstrels
were engaged. The Worrell Sisters, Maggie Moon
(now Mrs. Williamson) and Lotta were in the company,
and there was great rivalry between them at the
time. The theatre was crowded every night up to the
close of the first part in which there was a "walk
around," in which the girls entered into the liveliest
kind of a competition. Each did her utmost to out-dance
the other. Each favorite had her host of
admirers and the demonstration on the part of the
audience was intense. After the "walk around" the
house became almost empty, showing that this was the
attractive feature. Lotta was very ambitious, and
whenever she failed to score a triumph she would
retire to her dressing-room and cry bitterly. From
San Francisco her parents took her to New York,
where she gave her first performance at Niblo's Saloon,
June 1, 1864. She wasn't a success in New York, so
she went to Chicago and played "The Seven Sisters"
at McVicker's. Fortune began to smile on her there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
and her success dates from this point. One night during
this engagement an unknown admirer threw a
$300 gold watch and chain upon the stage. Lotta
cannot sing any more, but she kicks as cutely as of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
yore, dances neatly, and is as vivacious as a girl of sixteen.</p>

<p>Maggie Mitchell, who has been a great favorite ever
since she produced "Fanchon" at Laura Keene's
Theatre, June 9, 1862, was born in New York in
1832, of poor parents. She began to play child parts
at the old Bowery and in 1851 had advanced to
responsible business. She made a hit at Burton's
Theatre as <i>Julia</i> in "The Soldier's Daughter," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
then began starring in "The French Spy," "The
Young Prince," and like plays, but did nothing remarkable
until, as I have already said, she made a hit in
"Fanchon," an adaptation of George Sands's novel
"La Petite Fadette." Following this came "Jane
Eyre," "The Pearl of Savoy," and "Mignon."
Miss Mitchell has amassed a fortune by her efforts.
Her name off the stage is Mrs. Paddock, she having
married Mr. Henry Paddock, of Cleveland, Ohio, in
Troy, New York, October 15, 1868.</p>

  <div class="caption">EMMA ABBOTT.</div></div>

<p>Emma Abbott, the finest of American lyric artistes,
after the usual freaks of an ambitious childhood and
the trials of an operatic training in Milan and Paris,
was given a London engagement by Mr. Gye and
made her debut at the Royal Italian Opera, Covent
Garden, on May 2, 1876. The debut was a success,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
and with the congratulation of friends, the best wishes
of all who knew her, and the predictions of the best
judges of vocal music that she had a brilliant future
ahead of her, she set out on a tour of the provinces,
singing through England and Ireland and everywhere
winning the love and applause of the people. Returning
to her own country the artiste gave two seasons of
concerts, and began to sing light opera. She has
created the role of <i>Virginia</i> in "Paul and Virginia,"
and <i>Juliet</i> in "Romeo and Juliet," both which operas
she introduced here. Her repertory includes, besides
the two named, "Mignon," "Maritana," "The
Bohemian Girl," "Martha," "Il Trovatore," and
"Faust." She has a sweet, clear, crystalline voice,
which she uses to great effect, is a charming lady personally,
a careful, pure, and energetic artiste, and
altogether wholly deserves to be called, as she is,
"Honest Little Emma."</p>

<p>Marion Elmore, a charming little soubrette who is
looking after Lotta's laurels, is a native of England
and has been on the stage since her third year, having
then played <i>Meenie</i> with Joe Jefferson in "Rip Van
Winkle." She was born in 1860 in a tent on the gold
fields of Sandhurst, Australia. She came to this
country with Lydia Thompson in 1878, and played in
burlesque until the season of 1881&ndash;2 when she took
a soubrette part in Willie Edouin's "Sparks." She is
now starring under the management of Hayden &amp; Davis
in "Chispa," a California play.</p>

<p>Edwin Booth, the illustrious son of Junius Brutus
Booth, was born at Belair, near Baltimore, Maryland,
in November, 1833. He was his father's dresser,
accompanying him on all his tours, and receiving from
him lessons in histrionism. On September 10, 1849,
he made his first appearance at the Boston Museum as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
<i>Tressel</i>, in "Richard III.," and on May 22, 1850,
appeared at the Arch Street Theatre, Philadelphia, as
<i>Wilford</i>, in the "Iron Chest." In 1850 he distinguished
himself by playing "Richard III.," at the
Chatham Theatre, New York, in the place of his father,
who had disappointed. His first independent appearance
in the metropolis, however, was made on May 4,
1857, as <i>Richard III.</i>, at the Metropolitan, afterwards
the Winter Garden Theatre. In 1851 he went to California
and thence wandered to the Sandwich Islands
and Australia in 1854. In 1857 he returned to New
York. He was known as an actor of ability, but it
was not until his famous engagements at the Winter
Garden that he succeeded in making a really profound
impression on the public. During this revival "Hamlet"
ran one hundred nights and Mr. Booth at once
stepped to a foremost position before the public. His
disastrous investment in the theatre that bore his
name in New York is well known. It compelled him
to go into bankruptcy in 1872, since which time he
has been the most successful of American stars. He
has been twice married&mdash;to Mary Devlin, an actress
in 1861, who died in 1862, and to Mary McVicker,
daughter of J.&nbsp;H. McVicker, of Chicago, who died in
1881. His <i>Hamlet</i> is the finest interpretation of that
character on the American stage, and this with <i>Bertuccio</i>,
in "The Fool's Revenge," and <i>Brutus</i>, are his
best impersonations.</p>

<p>John McCullough, though born in Ireland, came to
this country when very young. He was poor and an
orphan, and poverty had been "looking in at the door"
of the humble home where he passed his boyhood for
many a year. Yet the tenant farm which his father
held was once the pride of all the country round, and
the child's earliest recollections called to mind a happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
time which too soon, alas, passed away. His mother
had died when the son was a mere lad, and misfortunes
came not singly but in hosts after that bereavement.
Sir Harvey Bruce, the landlord of the estate, though
a kindly man, as Mr. McCullough testified, claimed his
legal rights, and all that appertained to the estate held
by the family was taken possession of by law, and
father and son driven out from their home.</p>

<p>"How well I recall the time," said Mr. McCullough,
"and every scene and incident of that eviction&mdash;as it
would, I suppose, be called now. I was a boy of
about twelve years or so, and the greatest trial to me
was the sale of a pony which I prized most highly. I
couldn't bear to part with the pony, and Sir Harvey
Bruce, who saw my grief and knew its cause, kindly
arranged matters so that before long I was able to call
the animal once more my own. It was an act of goodness
which, of course, I have never forgotten."</p>

<p>Not long after the eviction the father died, and the
boy was left in the care of an uncle. But, like thousands
of others, young McCullough had heard of the
land of freedom beyond the Atlantic, and it was not
long before he decided to leave kindred and friends,
and seek a home in America. With all his earthly
possessions in a bundle the young lad landed at New
York, and with characteristic pluck and energy began
the battle for existence. He followed various callings,
but soon felt within him the desire to become an actor.
Fortunately the foreman of a chair factory in Philadelphia,
where he was employed, sympathized with the
aspirations of the future actor, and often studied with
him the great Shakespearean tragedies in which McCullough
afterward attained such renown.</p>

  <div class="caption">CALLED BEFORE THE CURTAIN.</div></div>

<p>It was in the winter of 1857 that the young aspirant
for Thespian honors first stood upon the stage; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
began in Philadelphia his professional career at the
munificent salary of $1 a week. For several seasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
he acted the "heavy villain" line in the Shakespearean
drama, and made steady improvement in his art. A
great event in his career was his engagement to support
the great Forrest in 1862; for it gave him opportunities
which such a man as McCullough was not slow
to improve. The grand qualities which marked
Forrest's acting were made the subject of careful study
by the young actor, and to-day John McCullough is recognized
everywhere as the successor to the famous
American tragedian. His career as an actor, interrupted
only by a brief managerial experience in San
Francisco, has been one of steadily increasing success.</p>

<p>John McCullough's starring experience dates from
only a few years back; yet his impersonations, with
peerless <i>Virginius</i> at the head, have won fame and fortune
in all parts of the country, and gained for him
also the highest honors on the English stage.</p>

<p>J.&nbsp;K. Emmett, or Joe Emmett, as he is familiarly
called the world over, was born in St. Louis on March
23, 1841. He early had a penchant for the stage,
and could rattle bones, play a drum or do a song and
dance on a cellar-door better than any of his companions.
He began life as a painter, but soon left the
pot and brush for the stage of the St. Louis Bowery,
where his specialty was Dutch "wooden-shoe business."
He could sing finely, and was as graceful as a
woman. So popular did he become in his line that
Dan Bryant engaged him for his New York house
in 1866. Two seasons later Charles Gayler wrote
"Fritz," a nonsensical play without rhyme or reason,
and Emmett opened with it in Buffalo. His success
was indifferent at first, but within a short time "Fritz"
and Emmett became the rage, and for fifteen years the
people have actually run after this star. His name
and play will fill any theatre in the United States, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
in many places outside of the United States. He is
the great pet of the public. Time and again has he
disappointed them, but it makes no difference; the
next time he announces himself ready to play they are
there in throngs. Joe Emmett has friends the whole
world over, and he is welcomed and admired everywhere.</p>

<p>John T. Raymond's real name is John T. O'Brien.
He became stage-struck while clerking in a store, and
after a brief amateur experience made his first appearance
on the professional stage as <i>Lopez</i>, in "The
Honeymoon," on June 27, 1853, and played comedy
with varying fortune until 1874, when "The Gilded
Age," which had been dramatized, was brought out at
Rochester, New York, on August 31st, and he made an
immense hit as <i>Col. Mulberry Sellers</i>. Next to
<i>Colonel Sellers</i>, John T. Raymond's enduring popularity
rests upon his impersonation of <i>Fresh, the American</i>,
in the drama of that name, which he is now
impersonating throughout the country. In connection
with both his best known parts Mr. Raymond may be
said to have "made" the plays they are framed in.
Without them those plays would be flat, and in any
other hands than his the characters which relieve them
of that odium would be insipid. It is the actor's art
and personal magnetism alone which make them what
they are&mdash;successes. A good story, whether it be
true or not, is told about Raymond and John McCullough.
The latter was asked to appear as <i>Ingomar</i>,
with Miss Anderson as <i>Parthenia</i>, at a benefit performance
for a friend. As an additional inducement the
beneficiary asked Raymond to play <i>Polydor</i>. "Certainly,
with great pleasure," said Sellers; "I will
travel one thousand miles any time to play <i>Polydor</i> to
McCullough's <i>Ingomar</i>." The happy man ran off to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
tell his good fortune to McCullough; but the tragedian,
in his deepest <i>Virginius</i> voice, answered him:
"No, sir, never, never again! Once and out." The
explanation of Mac's refusal to have Raymond in the
cast is given as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It seems that at a certain benefit in Virginia City,
"Ingomar" was the play, Mr. McCullough sustaining
the title role and Mr. Raymond played <i>Polydor</i>. <i>Polydor</i>,
it will be remembered, is the old Greek duffer
who has a mortgage on <i>Myron's</i> real estate, and presses
for payment in hopes to get <i>Parthenia's</i> hand in marriage.
The performance went beautifully, and the
applause was liberal, for McCullough was playing his
best. Raymond was the crookedest and most miserly
of <i>Polydors</i>, and the savage intensity he threw into his
acting surprised all who imagined he could only play
light comedy. All went more than well until <i>Ingomar</i>
offered himself as a slave to <i>Polydor</i> in payment of
<i>Myron's</i> little account. "What, you?" screamed
<i>Polydor</i>, and, apparently overcome by the thought,
he "took a tumble," and fell forward upon <i>Ingomar</i>.
<i>Ingomar</i> stepped back in dismay, when <i>Polydor</i>, on all
fours, crept nimbly between his sturdy legs and tried
to climb up on his back. The audience "took a tumble,"
and the roof quivered and the walls shook with
roars of laughter. "D&mdash;n you," groaned <i>Ingomar</i>,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sotto voce</i>, "if I only had you at the wings?" But
<i>Polydor</i> nimbly eluded his grasp, and, knocking right
and left the dozen supes, who were on as the army, he
skipped to the front of the stage and climbed up
out of reach of the projecting mouldings of the proscenium.
Here he clung, and, to make matters
worse, grinned cheerfully at the pursuers he had
escaped, and rapidly worked the string of a trick wig,
the long hair of which flapped up and down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
most ludicrous fashion. It was impossible for the play
to proceed, and the curtain was rung down, leaving
<i>Polydor</i> still on his lofty perch, while the audience
laughed and shouted itself hoarse. And this is the
reason why Mr. McCullough said, "No, sir, never
again!" to Mr. Raymond's offer.</p>

<span class="subhead">CHINESE AND JAPANESE THEATRICALS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>If the Chinese must go they will have to close up
the large theatres in San Francisco owned and controlled
by Celestial managers. In these temples of
the almond-eyed Thespis extraordinary plays are enacted
running through months and even years, in a
to-be-continued style, for, the Chinese dramatist, who
never writes anything but tragedy of the wildest and
most harrowing kind, always begins with the birth of
his hero or heroine and does not let the merest incident
pass until his or her friends are ready to sit down to a
feast of roast pig and rice by the side of the principal
character's grave. The dramas are mainly historical,
and many a Chinaman who starts in to see a first-class
play of the average length is on his way back to China
in a coffin or box with his cue neatly folded around
him for a burial robe, long before the last act of the
drama is reached. So, too, the star actors frequently
die before they have time to finish the play. I don't
know that any American has ever had the patience
to wait for the denouement of a Chinese drama, but
to the saffron-skinned, horse-hair-surmounted and
slanting-eyed citizen of San Francisco, his theatre is a
place next in importance to the Joss House or temple,
and when he once buys his season ticket for a show, he
sticks to it with a pertinacity that would put an ordinary
glue or cement advertisement to the blush. It is
the same, too, when they patronize a theatre in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
surroundings and language are English; once in their
seats, they stay&mdash;forgetting even to go out between
the acts for an opera-glass or a bottle of pop.</p>

<p>But to return to the Chinese theatre. Its interior
differs very little from the interior of the places of
amusement frequented by his American brother. The
general contour and arrangement of the auditorium is
pretty much the same. The men sit together on
benches partitioned off into single seats in the lower
portion of the house, or pit, with their little round
hats on, and their pipes or cigars in their mouths; the
ladies, who are not allowed into the male portion of the
auditorium, have galleries for themselves whence they
look down upon the actions of their male friends below.
Everywhere except on the stage quiet and the
utmost serenity prevail, no person in the audience
moving a hand, raising a foot, or opening a lip, even
when the villain is cut into ribbons by the Sunday-school
hero; and at no stage of the performance does
the slightest manifestation of delight or disapprobation
come from the patient and enduring on-looker.
In this respect John Chinamen has neglected to take
a lesson from his American cousin, or to acquire the
character of the howling short-haired gentlemen who
apotheosize Dennis Kearney and think there is no better
worshipping place in the world than "the sand lots."</p>

<p>The largest Chinese theatre in San Francisco is on
Washington Street and was opened in 1879. Its
auditorium is almost a copy of the best theatres
of the large cities of the country. Its audience
is seated and separated in the manner I have described,
and their behavior is, in accordance with
the custom of their country, quiet and respectful.
The stage of the theatre, though, is a curiosity.
There is no curtain, and but one scene that never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
changes. On the side of the stage&mdash;or proscenium&mdash;long
slips of colored paper with Chinese
characters on them are hung&mdash;the adages and axioms
of what is familiarly known as tea-chest literature&mdash;and
numerous multi-colored lanterns shed their radiance
around the place. At the back of the stage sit
several musicians with tom-toms, cymbals, fiddles, and
divers other instruments all of wonderful construction
and with frightful capacity for setting anybody but a
Chinaman crazy. These musicians seem to be as important
elements in the action and meaning of the
play as the actors themselves are. As soon as the performance
begins they immediately tune up, and from that
on until the show is over they never give the audience
or the music a single rest. The play usually begins at
five o'clock in the afternoon and continues until two
the following morning, so it will be readily understood
that the Chinese musician has a pretty wide scope for
his genius, while the Chinese audience must be more
than mortal to stand both the music and the actors for
some hours at a stretch. The actors make themselves
as hideous as possible, employing wigs and long beards
with plenty of paint to disguise themselves. They
stalk and stamp around in a manner highly suggestive
of the English-speaking "scene-eater," and there is
a great deal of stabbing and killing&mdash;thunder and
blood, so to speak&mdash;which is wasted, as the audience
does not seem to rise to the enthusiasm of the occasion
and there are no "gallery gods" to help bring
the house down. While the actors are shouting loudest,
the musicians, all of whom seem to be playing
different tunes, are working hardest and the din and
discord of a supremely grand moment of Chinese
tragedy are something horrible to hear and simply
torturesome to endure. Boys or young men play the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
female parts as was the custom on the English stage
in the time of Elizabeth. There is no levity in the
performance, no prancing or dancing, nothing but the
utmost severity and solemnity, which leaves me in
doubt whether the Chinese go to the theatre to be
amused or are compelled by some law of their country
or religion to do so.</p>

<p>The property-room of a Chinese theatre is a very
queer concern, filled up with lanterns, old clothes,
spears, etc., but the most extraordinary feature of the
place is the quantity of eatables that find their way
into the room and down the throats of the performers.
That most delicious morsel, roast pig, of whose discovery
by the Celestials Charles Lamb has written so
charmingly, occupies a prominent place on the board,
and is frequently attacked by the actors, who appear
to come off the stage as hungry as six-day go-as-you-please
pedestrians are when they leave the track.
When the Chinese actor is not acting or putting on his
costume you may depend upon it that he is eating.
This histrionic peculiarity is strongly marked among
the descendants of Ho-Fi, who if they are not good
tragedians have first-class appetites and stomachs
whose capacity is not measured by three meagre meals
a day.</p>

<p>A correspondent writing from Yokohama gives an
idea of the amusements served up in the Japanese
capital by its enterprising theatrical managers. The
Japanese, says this writer, are a theatre-going people,
and their taste is catered unto continually. Whether
the managers accumulate riches I know not, but theatrical
amusements are provided for the wants and means
of all classes. At the first-class establishment is a
revolving stage, upon which is placed the scenery and
properties devoted to the play on the boards. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
orchestra occupy the left-hand side of the stage, or
rather they are placed in an elevated pen at the left of
the stage floor. The revolving part of the business is
about fifteen feet from the foot-lights, the intervening
space being permanent. The wings are not elaborate,
and not much machinery is employed to work up
effects. The inevitable trap is utilized on this stage,
it being the only place that boasts of the improvement.
The actors at this theatre are of the first rank,
and their dresses are gorgeous in the extreme. "Regardless
of expense" must be their motto; and here
are produced all the famous plays known to the natives,
they being all of national significance.</p>

<p>The Japanese are patriotic in their instincts, and do
not run after strange representations with which to
amuse themselves. Everything on the board is intensely
Japanese&mdash;descriptive of their fables and
romances, as well as reproducing actual episodes in
the history of the empire. To the stranger who is
alien to the language their plays are first-class pantomimes
only, though one can but accord the actors rare
dramatic ability. I must say, however, that the style
affected in their stage step is something too awfully
too too for anything. The poetry of motion is a different
affair here from what is considered the correct
thing elsewhere. Keene or Billy Emerson could,
either of them, get a new kink in a stage walk if they
could study Japanese methods a while. It costs
thirty cents to enter the temples of dramatic art&mdash;that
is, to be in the place for the upper tendom, the gallery&mdash;or
dress circle, it may be called&mdash;which runs
on both sides of the house, as well as on the end fronting
the stage. This gallery is about five feet wide,
and is entered from the passage-way running along it
through openings in the partition without doors. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>is divided into spaces of five feet or more by placing a
round piece of timber of say two inches in diameter
from the gallery front and the back of it. The front
is elevated above the floor about fifteen inches only,
as the occupants are expected to sit upon their haunches
on the matted floor. Between acts tea is served to
any who will buy, and smoking is allowed all over the
house during the play. The body of the theatre is
supplied with benches without backs for the accommodation
of the audience.</p>

  <img src="images/i_348.jpg" width="531" height="336" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">CHINESE THEATRE.</div></div>

<p>There is no sharp practice in the way of reserved
seats in Japanese theatres. Neither is there necessity
to go outside for a clove or browned coffee. When
once seated you are at your ease, not having to draw
yourself up for any other fellow. The second-grade
places are of a cheaper order, where one can sit on the
floor, there being no seats, or stand upon the ground,
there being no floor, the earth doing duty in that regard.
One cent and a half and two cents and a half
give the grades of the establishments. They are all,
best as well as inferior, lighted with the domestic-made
candle, and when the original dips of our grandmothers
are remembered, the kind of a candle used is
described. The candles smoke as well as the audience.
There is a large stock of amusement to be had in a
one and a half cent concern, that is, if you are not
particular about the æsthetic nature of the surroundings,
and do not carry with you a cultivated musical
ear. These places do not carry on their pay-roll any
large number of star actors, or a numerous stock
company, and they do not devote much time to the
rehearsal of parts, as it is the duty of the prompter to
flit from one actor to another with the lines of the dialogue
in one hand, and in the other a stiff paper lantern.
Bending low, he reads in a tone readily caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
by the actor the lines, which are duly repeated, while
the prompter "is doing his duty" by the next one.
It is one of the most interesting features of a play,
this constant flitting of the prompter. If any fellow
about the establishment earns his pay, the prompter is
the man.</p>

  <img src="images/i_351.jpg" width="415" height="314" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">CHINESE PROPERTY-ROOM.</div></div>

<p>There are very many side-shows to attract the pleasure-seeker,
all of them being within the compass of
the humblest, the charge being from one-half cent to
one and one-half cents. In these places are witnessed
juggling tricks of real merit, and top-spinning that is
a bewilderment to the looker-on. Tops of all sizes
are spun with the aid of a string, and made to revolve
by the action of the hands only. An expert will
throw his top from him, and by the action of the string
as it unwinds draw it back so that it is caught in his
hand&mdash;of course, without it having touched the
ground. An unopened fan is then taken in the other
hand, and the top is placed upon one of its sides and
spun along it. Then the fan is opened, and the top
continues to spin along its edge to its farther side, and
along it until the hand is reached, when up it runs on
the arm to the shoulder, and across the back and down
the other arm, on to the fan again. Then it will be
tossed into the air and caught upon one of the corners
of the opened fan, from which it is tossed again and
again into the air and caught as it descends. It is
wonderful the way they can manipulate a top. I have
seen them take a large-sized one, having a spindle by
which it was made to rotate, and by simply placing the
spindle between the palms of the hands, and drawing
one hand back while advancing the other a number of
times it attained sufficient velocity, when it was taken
from the table on which it was spinning and a turn taken
around the spindle with a string that was pendant from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
a paper lantern hanging high up against the ceiling of
the building. Up went the top into the lantern, which
opened into the shape of an umbrella, and a wealth of
festoons of bright-colored tissue paper descended from
it all about the stage. Those who witnessed Little
All Right and the troupe of Japanese acrobats that exhibited
their tricks years ago in the United States will
remember the many surprising feats done by them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
What they paid $1 for seeing can be witnessed in
Yokohama in the open air for just what one is pleased
to contribute, or under cover for from one to three
cents.</p>

<p>There are no manifestations of applause, no cat-calls
or signs of impatience. In the places visited by even
the poorest, where the accommodations are of the
rudest, perfect order is observed, and every one seems
to be possessed of a patient quietness that is amazing.
They exhibit a deference for the comfort of their fellows
that is worthy of imitation. One great reason,
perhaps, that the people are so gentle and accommodating,
one to the other, may be found in their
complete sobriety. No exhibition of drunken rowdyism
is to be seen, and yet the entire people, women as
well as men, drink of the national beverage, "sake,"
a liquor distilled from rice. As there is no "tarantula
juice" in its composition, its inebriating quality
is rather mild. Its effect upon the brain is not lasting,
neither is it injurious.</p>

<span class="subhead">OPERA AND OPERA SINGERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ferdinand Palmo, who died in New York in September,
1869, as poor as the proverbial church
mouse, was the father of Italian opera in this country.
He was born in Naples in 1785 and came to America
when twenty-five years old, settling in Richmond, Virginia.
After remaining there six years he moved to
New York, but not proving successful in a business
venture returned to Virginia. After paying two visits
to Europe he again tried New York and built a café,
which he run until 1835 when he opened a saloon chamber,
which was afterwards converted by him into
Palmo's Opera House, and in which Italian opera was
for the first time presented to the American people
on February 2, 1844. The opening opera was "Il
Puritani," and during the season the best operas of
the day were produced. The venture, however, did
not prove a financial success. Palmo was reduced to
poverty. With the assistance of friends he opened a
small hotel, and after nine months became cook for a
Broadway restaurant "where," says a writer, "he
might often have been seen wearing his white apron and
square cap and engaged in preparing the delectable
dishes for which that establishment was noted." The
death of his employer threw Palmo out of work and
reduced him to straitened circumstances. As he
was too old to do anything, members of the dramatic
and musical professions met and organized a Palmo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
Fund, each person in the organization agreeing to pay
$13 per year toward the old man's relief, and he lived
comfortably on this fund until the day of his death.
It is a curious fact that no musical or theatrical celebrities
attended his funeral.</p>

<p>Forty years have effected a great change in the taste
of the people of the United States. Italian opera
now is one of the best paying things in the musical or
dramatic market. Announce a season of grand opera
in any city, and from that time on until the date of
opening the manager of the theatre in which the season
is to be held will be bothered by applicants for
places. Double and treble the ordinary price of admission
is asked, but that makes no difference; everybody
seems desirous of patronizing Italian opera, and
the extra price is paid without grumbling. These high
prices of admission must be paid because it costs a vast
amount of money to run Italian opera, transporting
large companies long distances, paying immense salaries,
and shouldering the enormous expenses of equipping
an opera organization and mounting the pieces.</p>

<p>It is a great sight to see an opera company travelling.
The principal singers must have their sleeping-cars
and dining coaches, those beneath them put up
with sleeping berths merely, while the members of the
chorus are crowded like emigrants into an ordinary
coach, from out which roll odors of fried garlic and
Italian sausage. When their destination is reached
the prima donne find carriages in waiting to drive
them to the best hotel in the place. The secondary
artists may also have carriages, but they go to minor
hotels, while the chorus people are left to themselves
to seek cheap boarding-houses and do the best they
can. Wagon loads of trunks follow the carriages and
wagon loads go to the theatre. Sometimes there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
scenery. For instance, Mapleson always carries the
scenery for "Aida," even to big cities where there are
first-class theatres. Hundreds of pieces of baggage
are left at the hotels, and hundreds at the theatre.
Immediately the troupe arrives the principal artists fall
into the hands of the interviewer, and as the tenor and
the prima donna and the others, too, are tired, the newspaper
man gets very little to write about unless he runs
across such a good fellow as Campanini, or happens to
meet Charles Mapleson, if it is Her Majesty's Company.</p>

<p>Then on the following morning comes the rehearsal.
The triumph is the usual sequel. All the young ladies
are immediately "mashed" on the tenor, and would
willingly follow the example of some New York
beauties, who went as a committee of the whole behind
the scenes one night to place a wreath of bay leaves
on the head of their favorite warbler, only they have
amateur tenors of their own by their sides who might
not relish such a display of their appreciation of good
music.</p>

<p>While her Majesty's Opera Company was having a
season at the Academy of Music, New York, two
years ago, a newspaper man interviewed Col. Mapleson,
the impresario, and took a look at the interior of
the establishment, exploring many of its mysteries.
In the course of the conversation he <span class="locked">asked:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"How many rehearsals do you give a new opera?"</p>

<p>"Ah, now I can tell you something that the public
know nothing of. A man of the crutch-and-toothpick
school, after I've put on, let me say 'Aida' at a cost of
$10,000, will come to me and say, 'Aw, I've seen
"Aida" twice; when are you going to give us something
new?' And the poor manager has to smile and
mount something equivalent to it immediately. Rehearsals!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Par example.</i> This is the sixth full-hand
rehearsal for the orchestra alone&mdash;drilling for two
and three hours&mdash;to get the light and shade of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pianissimo</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">forte</i>. After some more band rehearsals&mdash;the
slight alterations in the score by Arditi kept
four copyists at work all last night and until daybreak&mdash;the
principal artists rehearse about twenty
times with the piano; then comes a full rehearsal with
band, the artists seated all around the stage on chairs;
then the property-man has to have his rehearsal. The
carpenters now come in for their rehearsals, with
scene framers, etc. Then comes the first stage rehearsal,
with everybody without the scenery, and then
another with the scenery; later on again with the
properties and the business, and <i>then</i> it is fit for public
representation. Then a languid swell will tell me he
has seen the opera twice, and will want to know when
I am going to give something new."</p>

<p>An attendant here brought the colonel his letters,
over which he hastily glanced.</p>

<p>"Here is a letter from the Prince of Wales," he
exclaimed, showing me the note, dated Hotel Bristol,
Paris, October 22d. "It's in reference to his omnibus
box at Her Majesty's. While I am free for a
moment from my den, just take a tour of this place.
I'll act as guide, philosopher and friend. I'd like you
to see what's going on, and to let the public know
what a herculean task it is to run old operas, let alone
producing new ones."</p>

<p>We strode across the stage and plunged into a cavernous
passage, to emerge on a staircase and into a
property-room.</p>

<p>"What dummy is this?" demanded the colonel,
administering a kick to the decapitated form of a buxomly-proportioned
female, "and where's the head?"</p>

<p>It is the "Rigoletto" corpse.</p>

<p>We took a peep into the armory, which, from its
aroma of oil, painfully reminded me of my ocean experience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
Here the "Talismano" helmets, Oriental
of design; here the head-pieces worn in the "Puritani,"
reminding one of Cromwell's crop-eared knaves;
here the Italian so well known in "Trovatore."
Morions and breastplates and shields were here, and
matchlocks of ancient pattern, with guns of the Martini-Henry
design.</p>

<p>"Do you see these guns?" suddenly exclaimed the
colonel. "I bought four hundred of them for five
shillings a piece at an auction. They had been sold
by an English firm to the French government during
the Franco-Prussian war at a fabulous price. One
night, at Dublin, we were doing 'Der Freischutz,'
and poor Titjens was standing at the wing. One of
these guns was loaded with a little powder rammed
down by a piece of paper only. When fired, the lock
blew off, and a piece of it went right through Titjens's
dress, sticking in the wall behind her. What chance
had the French with such weapons in their hands?"</p>

<p>From the armory we proceeded to the barber shop,
where "Mignon," "Aida," "Traviata," and "Lucia"
wigs, curls, moustaches and beards showed grizzly on
shelves. A French barber was engaged in titifying
Campanini's wig for "Linda," and he expatiated on
its wonderful approach to nature with all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chic</i> of
his very expressive mother tongue.</p>

<p>In one of the wardrobes were the costumes for half
a dozen operas, each opera folded away and labelled.
Colonel Mapleson has about two thousand costumes
with him, and his packing-cases, each the size of a
small apartment, number nearly one hundred. We
found the Nilsson Hall full of newly painted scenery,
and the flies thronged with carpenters. The scene
painter's room was devoted to "Aida," while the
stage-man's room was choked full of flotsam and jetsam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
from the lamp of a Vestal Virgin to the statuette
of Cupid <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in puribus naturalibus</i>, and from a loaded
pistol to a roleau of stage gold.</p>

<p>"The stage brass band is rehearsing in the lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
regions, the principal artistes doing 'Trovatore' in
the first saloon, the chorus rehearsing 'Marta' in the
second saloon, the orchestra on their own ground
rehearsing 'Aida,' the ballet at work in a large room,
and a set of coryphees blazing away in a distant
corner. Listen!"</p>

<p>In the first saloon were the "Trovatore" party,
lounging around a piano, presided at by Bisaccia, the
accompanist to the company. Mlle. Adini, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">neé</i> Chapman,
the <i>Leonora</i>, was warbling right under the moustache
of her husband, <i>Aramburo</i>, the tenor who was
frantic because Mapleson refused £800 to release him
from his engagement; while Del Puente was slapping
his leg vigorously with his walking-cane, as he occasionally
burst in with a superb note in harmony with the
score. Madame Lablache leant with her elbows upon
the bar, and knowing every square inch of a role she
had performed from St. Petersburg to Gotham, turned
from the perusal of a newspaper at the right moment
in order to discharge the electricity of her <i>Azucena</i>,
while her daughter, who is studying for the operatic
stage, attended <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en amateur</i>, a toy black-and-tan terrier
in her arms. Having listened to a delicious <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">morceau</i>
from "Il Trovatore," we ascended to saloon No.
2, from whence a Niagara of melody was grandly
thundering. Here we found the chorus, numbering
about eighty, seated hatted and bonneted, with Signor
Rialp presiding at the pianoforte. The rehearsal was
"Marta." After visiting a dozen different departments,
every one of which is presided over by a vigilant
chief, we again found ourselves on the stage.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i>" exclaimed the colonel, "you have some
little idea of what I have to look after, and yet when I
produce a new opera, a crutch-and-toothpick fellow
will coolly ask me, after seeing it twice, when I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
going to give something 'new.' Do you know that
every one in that chorus you have just seen is an
Italian, and selected after considerable trouble and
great expense? Do you know what it costs me to
operatically rig up each member of that chorus?"</p>

<div id="ip_116" class="figcenter" style="width: 305px;">
  <img src="images/i_361.jpg" width="305" height="392" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">GERSTER.</div></div>

<p>"I cannot tell."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
"Well, it costs me $600, and it cost me $15,000 to
bring the troupe across the Atlantic. Do you know
what it costs me every time I ring up my curtain?
Two thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars, and
then add the weekly hotel bills, $2,200. I am doing
opera at Her Majesty's at this moment. Here's the
bill"&mdash;handing me the programme of Her Majesty's&mdash;"doing
the same operas as here, and that in order to
do them here, I am obliged to get a second set of
<i>everything</i>, from a drinking-cup to a bootlace, and this
costs me £120,000 before I started at all, as this is a
distinct and separate undertaking."</p>

<p>"How many operas does your repertoire include?"</p>

<p>"Thirty. I have thirty with me, and I can play
any one of them. Another element I have to deal with is
the superstition, or whatever you like to call it, of
some of my people. They won't go into any room in
a hotel with the number thirteen, and an artist won't
make his or her debut on the 13th; it is considered
unlucky. I once recollect having engaged Mme.
Grisi and Signor Mario for a tour in England, commencing
the 13th of September. On sending them the
programme, Mme. Grisi's attention was drawn to the
'thirteenth;' She thereupon wrote a very kind letter
stating that nothing could induce her to appear on the
'thirteenth;' but to show there was nothing mean
about her, she would rather commence it on the
'twelfth,' although her pay was to commence on the
'thirteenth.' I amended her programme and commenced
on the 'twelfth,' but as that date happened to
be a Friday it was again returned to me with a most
amiable letter, which I still preserve, in which she
stated again that there was nothing mean about the alteration,
as she would be the only loser; she therefore
desired me to commence it on the 'eleventh,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
when both she and Signor Mario would sing without
salary until the proper date of the commencement of
the contract. One of the artists went to Tiffany's the
other day to purchase a bangle. The price was $13.
'Won't you take less?' 'No.' And would you believe
it, she paid $14 sooner than pay $13."</p>

<p>We regained the managerial sanctum.</p>

<p>"Here is more of it," cried the impresario, "a
letter from Campanini. I'll read it to you. 'Dear
Mr. Mapleson: I am very ill, and cannot possibly sing
to-night unless you send me&mdash;some tickets for family
circle, balcony, parquette, and general circle. Campanini.'"</p>

<p>Here the colonel was summoned to hear a young
lady sing&mdash;an amateur who aspired to the vocal
majesty of grand opera. Upon his return, after the
lapse of a few minutes, I <span class="locked">asked:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"What opera pays the best, colonel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are a dozen trumps."</p>

<p>"Is not 'Carmen' one of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, 'Carmen' has been one of my best successes."</p>

<p>In conclusion, Colonel Mapleson <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I am nervous as to the future, as nearly every
coming artist has the misfortune to be American."</p>

<p>"Misfortune, colonel?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I use the word advisedly. Albani, Valleria,
Adini, Van Zandt and Durand, one of the best
dramatic prima donne on the stage, who, by the way,
has gone to sing at the Grand Opera in Paris instead
of coming here, and Emma Novada, a new prima&mdash;Candidus,
the tenor, too; all the coming talent is
American."</p>

<p>The salaries paid prima donne are very high. As
far back as 1870, Mme. Patti was paid $50,000 a year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
besides being given numerous presents by the Emperor
of Russia. Last winter Mr. Henry E. Abbey paid
Mme. Patti at the rate of eight times the imperial salary,
giving the diva $4,000 for each concert she sang
in, and she sang two in each week. Albani was paid at
the same rate as Patti in Russia. Nilsson, before her
retirement, got $1,000 a night in the provinces. Now,
that she is to return to the stage and come to America,
she will be paid probably as handsomely as Patti was.
Nearly all the foreign singers and artists have London
agents through whom American impresarios carry on
their negotiations. Gye is one of these agents and H.
C. Jarrett, of London, who accompanied Bernhardt,
as her agent, and who represents Nilsson, is another.</p>

<p>Singers and dramatic people, too, are fond of diamonds.
They have thousands of dollars' worth of
them; still they believe in investing in them because
they represent so much value in such little space. Sarah
Bernhardt had a wonderful wealth of these precious
stones, and Neilson was well provided with them. B.
Spyer, the St. Louis diamond merchant, with whom
theatrical and operatic people deal almost exclusively,
and who enjoys the patronage of nearly all foreign
artists who visit this country, told me a very funny
story about the first diamond he sold Christine Nilsson.
He had a splendid stone worth $4,000, and taking
it with him he went up to the Lindell Hotel, and
knocking at Nilsson's door was told to come in. He
opened the door and there on a sofa the great songstress
was reclining covered with an old calico gown.
He showed her the stone, but she did not want to buy
it and would not. Nilsson having left the room for a
while, Mr. Spyer approached the dressing-maid, who
was an old lady, and showing her a handsome diamond
ring told her he would give it to her if she used her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
influence to induce her mistress to buy the $4,000 diamond.
She said she would, and while they were talking
in walked a gray-haired old gentleman in common
clothes who looked like a servant, and whom Mr.
Spyer engaged in conversation. He told the old man
of his scheme with the dressing-maid, when the latter
said, "Tut, tut, she can do nothing for you; she's got
no influence."</p>

<p>"Then can you do anything?" Mr. Spyer asked.
"I'll make it all right if you help me to sell the
Madame that stone."</p>

<p>"Well," said the old gentleman, "I want a pair of
ear-rings for my daughters, who are in England."</p>

<p>"All right" was the diamond broker's answer; "you
use your influence and if I make the sale you shall
have the ear-rings."</p>

<p>The old gentleman said he would do what he could.
Mr. Spyer sold the diamond to Nilsson and in a few
days the old gentleman walked into his store and after
looking over the stock selected a $650 pair of ear-rings.
Spyer was surprised, but his surprise was greater
when he learned that the person he had taken for a
servant was none other than H.&nbsp;C. Jarrett, then and
now Nilsson's confidential agent.</p>

<p>Mr. Spyer told me another story which I may as
well bring in here, of how he sold a ring to Adelaide
Neilson for $3,000. Mr. Lee, who was then Neilson's
husband, was conducting the negotiations, and told
Mr. Spyer that he was going to buy some property in
Chicago, and would receive a telegram in regard to it,
to know whether his offer for the property had been
accepted or rejected. If he did not receive a telegram
by twelve o'clock noon the following day, he
would buy the ring. At noon next day Mr. Spyer was
at the Southern Hotel, where Mr. Lee and his wife were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
stopping. He asked the clerk if he had seen Mr. Lee
around the rotunda, and the clerk answered no, that
he himself was looking for Mr. Lee, as he had a telegram
for him.</p>

<p>"Well now, I'll tell you what to do&mdash;" mentioning
his first name, for the diamond merchant knew the
clerk, "you'll oblige me very much and do me a great
favor if you'll keep that telegram down here until I
go up stairs and see Lee."</p>

<p>The clerk agreed; Mr. Spyer went up stairs and sold
his diamond ring. Himself and Mr. Lee walked down
the stairs to get a drink. The clerk called Mr. Lee,
handed him the telegram and he opened and read it.</p>

<p>"By Jove, Barney," he said, holding out the telegram,
"if I'd gotten this ten minutes sooner I
wouldn't have bought that ring."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you didn't get it," Mr. Spyer responded.
"Let's go and have some Apollinarius."</p>

<p>One morning during that same week Mr. Spyer was
sitting in the store when Neilson came in alone and
bought a diamond ring for $175, paid for it and told
the merchant to say nothing to Philip about it. There
was nothing so very extraordinary in this; but when
Mr. Lee came in an hour afterwards and picked out a
ring about the same value and paying for it enjoined
Mr. Spyer to say nothing to Adelaide about it, he was
surprised at the remarkableness of the coincidence.
He never heard anything more about either of the
rings.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MINSTREL BOYS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The idea of negro minstrelsy in its present shape
originated forty years ago with Dan Emmett, Frank
Brower, Billy Whitlock and Dick Pelham. This happy
quartette organized the Virginia Serenaders in 1841,
giving their first performance on December 30th. An
idea of the "first part" furnished by that combination
was given last season, when Dan Emmett himself appeared
with three others in an act in which the old
jaw-bone figured, and the other instruments were
banjo, tambourine and fiddle. Fifty years before the
time of the Virginia Serenaders a Mr. Grawpner is
said to have blacked up at the old Federal Street
Theatre, in Boston, where he sang an Ethiopian song
in character. The first of the negro melodies that
have been preserved is "Back Side of Albany Stands
Lake Champlain." It was sung by Pot-Pie Herbert,
a Western actor who flourished long before the days of
"Jim Crow," Rice, or Daddy Rice, as they called
him. Herbert's song was as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Daddy Rice was employed in Ludlow &amp; Smith's
Southern theatre as property-man, lamp-lighter, stage
carpenter, etc., and he made no reputation until he
began jumping Jim Crow, in Louisville, Kentucky, in
1829, after which he became famous and made a fortune
by singing his song in this country and England.

<p>George Nichols, a circus clown, claims to have been
the first negro minstrel, and some award this distinction
to George Washington Dixon, who disputes the
authorship of "Zip Coon" with Nichols, who first
sang "Clare De Kitchen," which he arranged from
hearing it sung by negroes on the Mississippi. Bill
Keller, a low comedian, was the original "Coal Black
Rose," in 1830, John Clements having composed the
music. Barney Burns, a job actor and low comedian,
first sang "My Long Tail Blue," and "Such a Getting
up Stairs," written and composed by Joe Blackburn.
These were all about Daddy Rice's time, and
nearly all the songs of the day were constructed in the
style of "Jim Crow." They were taken from hearing
the Southern darkies singing in the evenings on their
plantations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
In the year following the organization of the Virginia
Serenaders the original Christy Minstrels were organized
by E.&nbsp;P. Christy, in Buffalo. The troupe consisted
of E.&nbsp;P. Christy, Geo. Christy (whose real name
was Harrington), L. Durand and T. Vaughn. They
first called themselves the Virginia Minstrels, but
changed to Christy Minstrels in a short time, when
Enon Dickerson and Zeke Bakers joined them. The
party continued to give concerts up to July, 1850, when
E.&nbsp;P. Christy died and was buried in Greenwood.
George Christy had withdrawn in October, 1853, owing
to some dispute between himself and E.&nbsp;P. His
salary during the two years and six months preceding
the withdrawal amounted to $19,680. The
troupe gave two thousand seven hundred and ninety-two
concerts during its existence, took in $317,589.30,
paid out $156,715.70, and had a profit
left of $160,873.60. The profits of the first year did
not exceed $300. Companies were now springing up
everywhere, and so great was the rage for ministrelsy
that the troupes were obliged to give morning concerts.
The entertainment has been one of our public amusements
ever since, and a good company of burnt cork
artists can command a good house anywhere. Following
the spirit of enterprise of the age and the tendency
to gigantic proportions in everything, minstrelsy has
developed into Mastodon Megatherion and other
mammoth organizations. End men by the dozens, song
and dance men by the scores and no less than forty
("count 'em") artists now amuse the public that was
satisfied with four in '41. By the way it was in this
year on July 4th, that bones were first played before an
audience, the player being Frank Brower of the Virginia
Serenaders.</p>

  <img src="images/i_370.jpg" width="284" height="395" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">GEORGE CHRISTY.</div></div>

<p>George Christy, who was the most celebrated Ethiopian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
performer the world knew in those days was
born in Palmyra, State of New York, November 3,
1827. He was sent to school at an early age, and
although he excelled in all the branches of education
peculiar to boys of his age, after school hours the
master often found him at the head of a party of boys
whom he had assembled together for the purpose of
giving theatrical entertainments, or, as they called it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
a <i>show</i>. George was, as he ever has been, the very
head and front of this species of amusement; and
subsequently, under the auspices of E.&nbsp;P. Christy,
made his debut as Julius, the bone-player, in the
spring of 1839, and afterwards attained to the very
first rank in his profession. He survived his namesake
many years.</p>

<p>The only fault to be found with the minstrelsy of the
present day is the coarseness that pervades many of the
sketches and crops out in the songs and funny sayings.
The old-time negro character has been sunk out of
sight and the vulgarity of the gamin has taken the
place of the innocent comicalities that were in vogue
forty years ago. It is true that the negro character
has undergone a change and that the black man now
vies with his white brother in everything that is low
and vicious; but the criticism still holds good that
negro minstrelsy is not what it was or what it ought to
be, and that no matter how grand its proportions
may be made by enterprising managers the many
features that make it objectionable to fastidious people
must be pruned off before it can be said to be deserving
that full recognition which the public always accords to
whatever is good in the amusement line.</p>

<p>The negro minstrel is an institution entirely outside
of the pale of commonplace people. He talks differently
from other people, acts differently, dresses
differently. A "gang of nigger singers" can be
identified three blocks away by an ordinary observer
of human nature. They have a fondness for high and
shining silk hats that are reflected in the glaze of their
patent-leather, low-quarter shoes every time they pull
up their light trousers to look at their red or clocked
silk stockings. Their clothes are of a minstrelsy cut,
and like the party who came to town with rings on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
fingers and rings on her toes, they must have their
fingers covered with amethysts or cluster-diamond
ornaments, and they rarely ever fail to display a
"spark" in their gorgeous shirt fronts. They are
"mashers" of the most pronounced type on the stage
and off, and just as soon as they take possession of a
small town, it is safe to say that all the feminine
hearts lying around loose will be corraled within
twenty-four hours of their arrival. They are as generous
now as they were years ago, and few of them
save a cent for the frequently mentioned rainy day.
The very best of them have died in poverty, and found
graves only through the charity of friends. Johnny
Diamond and his partner, Jim Sanford, the former of
whom helped Barnum in his first steps along the road
to fortune, both died in the same Philadelphia alms-house.
They had commanded big salaries, but dressed
flashily and lived fast, and when the rainy day came
they had to run for shelter to a public charity. Very
few performers who die in poverty now are allowed
to seek any other than the charity of their professional
brethren. The Benevolent and Protective Order of
Elks takes care of the unfortunates, assisting them
generously while living and giving them decent burial
at their death.</p>

<p>As I said, the minstrel boy is an irresistible "masher."
His particular weakness is women, with wine often
only a little behind. He lives at as rapid a rate
as his salary will allow, and turns night into day by
"taking in the town" after the performance. They
frequently get into scandalous history owing to the
promiscuousness with which they pick up with
petticoats, and their amours get them into great
trouble. Women seem to have a lavish fondness for
the end-man, and many of them have left husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
children, and home to follow the fortunes of a fickle
minstrel. The story of the Chicago gambler's wife
who ran off with Billy Arlington is still fresh in the
minds of the people of the city by the lake, and still
fresher is that of the St. Louis <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">demi-mondaine</i> who
sold out her house to be always near her "Johnny,"
who, I think, was one of the Big Four.</p>

  <div class="caption">"YOU ARE THE SORT OF A MAN I LIKE."</div></div>

<p>A mash that created a sensation, though, was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
that developed in a New York Bowery theatre, one
night, when a young woman elegantly attired jumped
out of a private box, and embracing a performer who
was just finishing a banjo solo, shouted in a voice that
was clear and loud, "You're the sort of a man I like!"
The audience cheered lustily and the young woman
accepted the applause with a courtesy, while the banjoist
staggered into the wings, too much amazed to be
flattered. A young man from whose side the lady had
made her leap upon the stage, succeeded with some
difficulty in coaxing her back into the box and the
show went on. The pair had been dining and wining
together, and the young gentleman had not been as attentive
to his companion as she thought proper. So
she had chosen the original method of at once rebuking
and shaming him. She succeeded. He did not
dare to look at another woman on or off the stage
again until the curtain fell.</p>

<p>Those who have never witnessed the rehearsal of a
minstrel company can have but a very faint idea of the
amount of worry and vexation to which the manager
is subjected before he becomes satisfied that the company
has mastered the work so that it is in a condition
to present to the public. The scene at a dramatic
rehearsal is the scene of perfect peace and harmony
compared with that of a minstrel company. The difference
is caused by the fact that dramatic performers
study their lines and business carefully, and have the
idea constantly before them that they must adhere to
the text and the author's ideas closely, while minstrels,
or "nigger singers" as they are called by members of
the profession, work with only one end in view, and that
is, to be funny. A minstrel having a speech of a dozen
lines will make it twenty-five times and never make it
twice alike. Every time he speaks it he will drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
out something or insert something which the author
did not intend to be there. The result is that a manager
superintending a rehearsal is in hot water, figuratively,
all the time. If he storms and swears at the
performers, he only makes matters worse, and, therefore
while he is inwardly boiling with vexation he must
retain a calm exterior and appear as smiling as a June
morning. There have been well authenticated cases
where minstrel managers have been driven to strong
drink by the intense strain upon their mental faculties
occasioned by superintending rehearsals. These cases,
however, are rare.</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of Manager J.&nbsp;A. Gulick, I
had the pleasure, last spring, of witnessing a rehearsal
of Haverly's Mastodon Minstrels. I took a seat under
the shadow of the balcony to watch developments, and
passed ten or fifteen minutes in inspecting the dull,
dismal aspect of the house. Everything was quiet and
oppressively sombre. Occasionally a scrub woman
who was working a broom in the dress circle would
bark one of her shins against one of the iron chair-frames
and sit down and howl in a subdued tone, but
beyond this there was nothing to break the stillness
until the members of the company began to arrive.
Presently the orchestra came in and began to tune up
their instruments to a condition proper for the promulgation
of sweet strains, and then the comedians and
singers came sauntering in on the stage. Apparently,
the first duty of each and every one of them upon getting
out of the wings, was to execute a shuffle, cock
his hat over his left eye and swagger off up the stage
with a satisfied smile. Each having been successfully
delivered of his matutinal shuffle, and having satisfied
himself that he hadn't contracted the "string-halt"
during the night, all seated themselves and awaited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
appearance of the manager. Divested of their burnt
cork and stage toggery, the company looked more like
a collection of well-to-do young men in the commercial
walks of life than minstrel performers. All
looked as if they had passed a comfortable night, and
had not indulged in those revels which are erroneously
supposed to be inseparable from the life of a minstrel.
Consequently I was bound to conclude that they had
said their prayers at 11:30, and at midnight were
snoring the snores of the innocent and blessed. The
only member of the company who looked as if he
might have gone wrong on the previous night was Frank
Cushman. His right eye was bloodshot, and he had a
protuberance on his forehead over the optic such as
might be raised by the kick of a mule. His condition
was afterward explained by the fact that in attempting
to make a "funny fall" in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," on
the night previous, he had made a miscue and had received
a genuine fall, striking on his head. Suspicion
was therefore allayed, and I became satisfied that Cushman,
too, had said his prayers and had gone regularly
to bed unloaded.</p>

<p>Promptly at eleven o'clock, the hour set for rehearsal,
Manager Gulick arrived and proceeded at once to
business by delivering an address to the orchestra
<span class="locked">leader:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Now we don't want any break in this first part
finish to-night. You want to make that first chorus
very forte and then work it off gradually very piano.
Then when they all come on you want a short wait and
then a crash&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>The leader nodded to indicate that he saw.</p>

<p>"Then," resumed Mr. Gulick, "when you hear the
pistol fired, work in that te um iddle de te um ah tiddle
um tiddle tah&mdash;see?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
The leader again saw, and the manager continued:</p>

<p>"Then when you come to 'The girl I left behind
me,' put in la la tum liddle la la tum liddle ah&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>But without waiting to see whether the leader saw
or not the manager turned to the company with:
"Now, boys, get down to business and we'll rehearse
that first part finish."</p>

<div id="ip_119" class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">
  <img src="images/i_378.jpg" width="275" height="401" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">JIM CROW.</div></div>

<p>Then there was a rush of the "40-count 'em"
down to the foot-lights, and everybody began to talk.
Each man struck a different subject and a different key
apparently, and the finish appeared to be so thoroughly
jumbled up that it seemed an impossible task to
straighten it out again. But the performance appeared
to be an adjunct of the rehearsal, for when it was finished
Mr. Gulick took his seat at the foot-lights, while
the company arranged itself in the usual semi-circle,
with E.&nbsp;M. Kayne, the interlocutor, in the centre.
More instructions were given by the manager, when a
young man rushed in and performed the pantomime of
handing Mr. Kayne a telegram, which the latter pantomimically
opened and calmly announced that he had
just received news that he had just won the prize of
$50,000 in the Kentucky State lottery. He didn't
make as much fuss over it as any other man would over
finding a half-dollar on the street. The news must
have pleased him, for he <span class="locked">remarked:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Boys, I'm in luck."</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Billy Rice.</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand dollar prize," replied Mr. Kayne.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" said Rice.</p>

<p>"Take us out and treat us," said Cushman.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you I was a Mascot," said another.
They all called for lemonade, and Mr. Kayne compromised
the matter by agreeing to take them all to Europe
on a pleasure trip if they would pack their trunks in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
five minutes. A chorus was then sung and the trunks
were announced packed. Jimmy Fox then came
forward and announced that he was captain of the
Pinafore. The other members of the company must
have been looking for him, for they shot him dead with
a vociferous "bang!" and then proceeded to sing
"Glory Hallelujah," over his corpse. This brought
him to life again and he was readmitted to the excursion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
party. One of the vocalists then sang "Old
Folks at Home," and at its conclusion Mr. Kayne asked
if there was no one else to whom they wished to say
"good-by," but all responded, "No, not one."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is," said Mr. Kayne, and the orchestra
opened with "The Girl I Left Behind Me."</p>

<p>The rehearsal was interspersed with very sweet little
melodies, which redeemed such verses as this:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our trunks are packed and our passage is paid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sail o'er the ocean blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the briny wave we're not afraid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sail o'er the ocean blue.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Then Cushman <span class="locked">sang:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, fare you well, St. Louis girls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fare you well for awhile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll sail away in the month of May<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And come back in July.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Rice retaliated <span class="locked">with:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fare you well, you dandy coons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll show you something grand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll sail away o'er the ocean blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till we reach the promised land.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>There was nothing strikingly classical about the
words, but the melody was charming, and covered them
with a charitable cloak.</p>

<p>The first part finish having been rehearsed, Manager
Gulick discovered some flaws in it and ordered it to be
done over again. On hearing this the man at the bass
viol looked up piteously at Billy Rice and <span class="locked">asked:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Are we going through it again?"</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Rice; "do you want to rest
all the time?"</p>

<p>This question was not answered and the bass viol
dropped into a seat apparently completely discouraged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
The piece was rehearsed, not once only, but half a
dozen times, and when it was pronounced all right the
bass viol gave a sigh of relief that shook the building.</p>

<p>Several songs were then rehearsed, during which
everybody was busy. At one side of the stage the
quartette was singing, Cushman was practising an end
song, the orchestra was at work on an overture, three
or four men were brushing up on a farce, two song-and-dance
men were inventing new steps, and Charley
Dockstader was reading the <i>Clipper</i>. It was an exceedingly
lively scene, and there was noise enough to
wake the dead. Vocal and instrumental music fought
a pitched battle, while the dancers hammered the stage
with their feet as if by way of applause. A boiler-shop
is a haven of rest beside a minstrel rehearsal at
this stage.</p>

<p>The rehearsal lasted nearly two hours without a
rest, and was as utterly unlike a minstrel performance
as can well be imagined. There was nothing particularly
amusing in it except its oddity, and yet when it
was presented with black faces and varied costumes it
caused roar upon roar of the heartiest laughter, because
those who saw it then had not seen how the performance
was constructed.</p>

</div>

<p>There are two kinds of clowns familiar to people
who patronize amusements&mdash;the clown who juggles
old jokes in the circus ring, and the clown whose
only language is that of facial expression, and
whose grins and grimaces together with his extraordinary
antics and white face are more acceptable to and
interpretable by childhood than the ancient and petrified
humorisms of his brother laugh-maker of the sawdust
circle. There is no circus clown in the world
could stretch the heart-strings of an audience as far and
hold them there longer than George L. Fox, the king
of pantomimic merry-makers. His was a face readable
as the pages of a book printed in good large type, and
the wonderful swift changes that came over it were like
fleecy clouds and sunshine chasing each other across a
summer sky. Poor Fox, who sent a thrill of joy into
the hearts of thousands of little folks and caused their
rosy lips to over-bubble with silvery laughter, his was
a hard, an undeserved fate&mdash;death in a madhouse,
without a glint of reason to light him on his journey
across the dark river. He has left no successor more
worthy of his place than George H. Adams, whose talent
obtained him the recognition of Adam Forepaugh,
the showman, with whom he is now in partnership.
Frazier and clowns of minor merit fill the rest of the
places, but Adams is at the top of the heap, and may be
fitly termed the Grimaldi of to-day.</p>

  <div class="caption">GEORGE H. ADAMS IN HUMPTY DUMPTY.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
It is pleasant to visit a theatre during the progress
of a pantomime. The house is filled with old and
young in equal proportions, or if there is any preponderence
it is on the side of the little folks, who clamber
up on the backs of chairs and laugh freely and sweetly as
the birds in the forest sing, every time they catch sight
of the chalked head of the clown and the gray tuft
standing like a turret above poor old Pantaloon's wig.
And the old people laugh all the heartier because the
innocent young people have their hearts and mouths
filled with joy. The pantomime may be "Humpty
Dumpty" or "The Magic Flute" or "The Merry
Miller"&mdash;call it by whatever name you will, an
intense interest is taken in it, and new enjoyment is
found in every performance. The tricks are the same,
the mechanical effects identical with those of every
other pantomime you may have seen, and even the
specialty sketches that divide the acts of the dumb
show seem to be of very close kindred with those of
former attractions of this kind. Still everybody enjoys
the fun just as many people laugh at the "chestnuts"&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vulgariter</i>,
old jokes&mdash;of the man in motley attire,
who tries to make the patrons of the circus feel happy.</p>

<p>It makes no difference to the miniature men and
women who are Humpty Dumpty's best friends and
admirers, how the mechanical effects of a pantomime are
produced. They do not care much to know that the
pig Humpty Dumpty and Pantaloon stretch across the
width of the stage in an endeavor to tear it from each
other, has a rubber body; that the bricks the clown
throws at everybody are only paper boxes; that the
trick pump is worked from the side scenes with a
string; that the clothes which suddenly, and as if by
some invisible influence, vanish into the sides of houses
or up through windows have light but strong black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
thread, which the little ones cannot see at a distance, attached
to them; the big policeman is to them a stern
and gigantic reality; and it affords them more fun to
imagine every time Humpty throws or makes a blow at
anybody, that the stinging sound is a sure indication that
his aim was well taken&mdash;they do not know that the
sound as of receiving a blow is the result of slapping
the hands together. All the simple illusions of the
scene and of the action are to them actual facts, and
they appear all the more ridiculous and are all the
more effective on this account. When Humpty
Dumpty dives through the side of a house, disappearing
behind, there are men in waiting to catch him, and
when he sits down to read his newspaper and the candle
begins to grow beyond his reach, then falling as he
attempts to go higher with a sudden bang, and the
clown comes tumbling down after it as Jill did after
Jack when they went up the hill for the bucket of
beer, few of the big or little people know that the candle
runs down through one of the legs of the table and
is all wood except the waxen bit at the top. All these
little mysteries have their charms for the years of
childhood, and in no country are the pleasures of the
pantomime so fully recognized as in England, where on
Boxing Night&mdash;the 26th of December&mdash;children crowd
the theatres to witness the Christmas pantomime. In
some theatres here the custom of providing pantomime
for the Christmas holidays is adhered to, but as there
are not enough Grimaldis or Foxes or Adamses or
Fraziers to go around, the supply being very limited,
we cannot compete with England in this respect.</p>

<p>As Adams is the only pantomimist who can lay any
claim to the mantle of George L. Fox&mdash;if clowns can
be said to have mantles&mdash;a short biography may not be
out of place. He is twenty-eight years old, is a native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
of England, and is the eldest son of Charles H.
Adams, one of the best Pantaloons in the country.
He comes from a family of circus people, being a descendant
of the famous Cookes, riders and clowns,
and is a cousin of W.&nbsp;W. Cole, the circus manager.
He was apprenticed to the manager of Astley's, in
London, when he was six years of age, and remained
there eight years. After appearing as clown with a
circus in Denmark, he came to America, and for several
years travelled with different circuses. His first
appearance as clown in the pantomime was in Brooklyn,
New York, in 1872, under the management of Tim
Donnelly, who gave a pantomime every year during the
Christmas holidays. His father was the stage manager
for Donnelly, and suggested to George the idea of
playing clown. George refused at first, but finally at
his father's earnest solicitation decided to go on. He
made an unmistakable hit, and from that time deserted
the sawdust arena and adopted the stage. After several
successful seasons with Nick Roberts and Tony
Denier he last season accepted an offer of partnership
with Adam Forepaugh to run a show under his own
name.</p>

<p>In the last Christmas number of the London <i>Graphic</i>
I found the following excellent article on "Boxing
Night" as the little folks of London enjoy it: "The
very first night of anticipated pleasure has come to
nine-tenths of the little ones who gaze upon the scene
in silent wonder and astonishment. Imagination in its
wildest dreams never pictured anything so wonderful as
this. There have been little theatricals at home, plays
in the back drawing-room; some fairy tale has been
enacted for which kind sisters have supplied the wardrobe,
whilst mamma has presided over the piano orchestra.
It was good fun to crawl across the mimic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
stage in a hearth-rug, pretending to be a wolf or bear,
and to hear the laughter of kind friends in front; but
all that home amusement, the curiosity and contrivances,
the songs and dances were, indeed, child's play
when compared to a real theatre on Boxing Night.
What importance is given to the child by being considered
old enough to sit up so late as this; what a
sense of mystery and wonderment to be driven through
the lighted streets; to see the decorated shops set out
with Christmas presents and New Year's gifts; and to
behold for the first time, the bright electric light on
the bridges and embankment! But this is far better
than all, and only a very little removed from fairyland.
How the myriad lights in the great chandeliers glisten
and sparkle, and the stage foot-lights dazzle; how
splendidly the orchestra seems to play; and hark! the
boys in the gallery are taking up the tune, and singing
together with wonderful swing and precision. One
comic song and street tune follows another; the band
suggests and the young musicians take it up with a
will. Just now they had been a pelting of the pit with
orange peel&mdash;all in good fun, of course. The lads in
their shirt sleeves had whistled and screamed, and
saluted friends in distant corners of the gallery; but
now all this horse play is quieted by music and melody.
It is Boxing Night, and there must be patriotism as
well as pleasure. 'Rule Britannia,' 'God bless the
Prince of Wales,' and 'God Save the Queen,' are sung
from thousands of lusty throats, and all the audience
rise to their feet, waving hats and handkerchiefs.
Loyalty is as necessary as love at Christmas-time.
And what has that good old wizard Blanchard prepared
for the happy children? He must be as immortal as
Father Christmas, and certainly is quite as popular.
He will be the guide up the rocks of romance, and
away to the fields of fairyland. He will lead his happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
followers amidst ogres and giants and elves and fays,
to wizard castles and enchanted dells; now you will be
at the bottom of the sea, where lovely queens wave
sea-weed wands; and now on land amidst the yellow
corn-fields and the bluebell lanes. There will be song
and dance, and the madcap pranks of thousands of
children, liliputian armies and glittering armor, poetry
and processions, hobby-horses and the dear old
Clown and Harlequin and Pantaloon supporting 'airy
fairy' Columbine, if they would only ring that
prompter's bell and pull up that tantalizing curtain.
The noise is hushed, the music stops, the overture is
over&mdash;but wait.</p>

<p>"What are they doing behind the curtain? There
are beating hearts also in the manufactory of pleasure.
Christmas-time means food and raiment to the great
majority of those who are awaiting the prompter's
signal. They have come from courts and alleys, from
cold, comfortless rooms, from care and poverty, from
watching and from want, to this great busy hive that
uncharitable people abuse and ridicule. Times have
been bad, the winter has advanced too soon, wages
have been slack; but all will be mended now that
Christmas has come again. Hearts beat lightly under
the prince's tunics and the dancers' bodices, for every
mickle makes a muckle, and there is work here, from
the proud position of head of the Amazonian army to
the humble individual who earns a shilling a night for
throwing carrots in a crowd and returning slaps in a
rally. And the training and discipline of the rehearsals
up to this anxious moment have not been without
their advantage. Punctuality, silence, order, and
sobriety are the watchwords here. There have been
no idling, dawdling, and philandering, as many silly
people imagine. Even the little children have learned
something, perhaps their letters, perhaps the art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
singing in unison, certainly the merit of being smart
and useful. But now it is the great examination day.
The lessons are over, and the result is soon to be
known. What a wild fantastic scene it is&mdash;a very
carnival of costumes. Fairies and hop-o'-my-thumbs,
monkeys, and all the miscellaneous mixture of the
menagerie, gorgeous knights in armor and spangled
syrens, Titania and her train, pasteboard chariots,
wands and crystal fountains, fruits and forest trees,
mothers, dressers, carpenters, and costermongers for
the crowd, all mixed up in apparent confusion, but in
reality as well drilled and disciplined as an army prepared
for action. All belong to some separate department
or division; there is a leader for every squad,
who is responsible for his men, and if anything goes
wrong a prompt fine is a very wholesome punishment.
It has been weary work during the last few rehearsals,
and certain scenes have had to be repeated again and
again. The testing of the scenery has delayed the
action, and it has been late enough before these busy
bees have got to bed. But the excitement of the moment
gives new vitality. The night has come, and
everyone is bound to do his or her best. Everything
is smart and new, and the girls and children are proud
of their costumes, in which they strut about admiringly.
The stage manager has recovered his amiability,
and calls everyone "my dear." A rapid, business-like
glance is cast over the various scenes to see that
everything is straight and ship-shape; the reports come
up from the various departments to say there are no
defaulters. The gas man is at his post, and the limelight
man at his station. The ballet master, with his
flag in hand, is standing ready on his stool. Ready?
Yes, sir! is the answer. Up go the foot-lights with a
flare, a bell rings, the curtain rises, and the happy
people before and behind the Christmas curtain meet."</p>

<span class="subhead">VARIETY DIVES AND CONCERT SALOONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Outside of the legitimate theatres there is a large
variety of places of amusement&mdash;that is, they are
called places of amusement, but the fumes of vile
tobacco, the odor of stale beer, the fiery breath of
cheap whiskey, the sight of filthy women and filthier
men, and the most excruciating and torturesome kind
of music, all combine to make the resort anything but
pleasant and the while the incidents that attract the
visitor's attention are anything but amusing. There
is, of course, no complaint of this sort to urge against
the first-class variety theatres. These cater in a modest
way to a low standard of intellect, but usually their
programmes are chaste enough, and unless a person
has an aversion to having beer spattered over his
clothes by unhandy waiters while ministering to the
thirsty wants of a neighbor in the same row, or objects
to the attention of the gay girls who open wine in the
private boxes and flirt with the people in the parquette,
he will find a first-class variety show as pleasant a place
as a good, long, mixed programme with the Glue
Brothers in song and dance at one end, the Irish Triplets,
in "select vocalisms and charming terpsichorean
evolutions," in the middle, and a lugubrious sketch at
the other end can make it. By some mysterious law
known only to variety performers, the variety stage
only about once in a century produces anything new or
anything attractive. In the good old days of the ballet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
there was drawing power in the display of shapely
limbs and the graceful music-of-motion like manner in
which the girls tip-toed or pirouetted across the stage;
or when the variety theatre was as much the home of
spectacle as the legitimate houses pretended to be,
and on the Vaudeville stage scenes were presented
that belonged to the same class of labyrinthine scenery
and profuse female beauty that the "Black Crook"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
and "The Green Huntsman" were the representatives
of. When spectacles were the rage and the fencing
scene in the "Black Crook" would set the boys
at the top of the house wild with joy, the variety
theatre had among the bright stars of its stage actors
and actresses who are now among the most popular,
and certainly among the heaviest money-makers, who
appear in the legitimate houses.</p>

<p>Joe Emmett graduated from the variety theatre.
Gus. Williams was a shining light on the same stage.
J.&nbsp;C. Williamson was a variety artist. Geo. D. Knight
did "Dutch business" in the minor theatres before he
got to be famous as <i>Otto</i>. I recollect having seen
Knight play <i>Rip Van Winkle</i> in Deagle's old variety
theatre on Sixth Street, in St. Louis, and he played it
well&mdash;not like Jefferson, of course, but it was his first
attempt at the part, and if Jefferson did any better the
first time he must not have improved very much since.
This was twelve years ago. Mrs. Geo. Knight
(Sophie Worrell) danced on a concert saloon stage in
San Francisco. So did Lotta, and so did Mrs. Williamson.
Den Thompson, whose <i>Joshua Whitcomb</i> is
a perfect picture of the New England farmer, first tried
this same character in the variety theatre, and Neil
Burgess and the "Widow Bedotte" were first introduced
to the public as the tail-end of a nigger-singing
and specialty programme.</p>

<p>Those were the palmy days of the variety show
before negro ministrelsy had grown to its present
enormous proportions and before plays were written so
as to take in a whole variety entertainment, and under
the disguise of comedy or farce or burlesque foist a
lot of specialty people from a first-class stage upon
an intelligent audience. The musico-mirthful pieces
that began to blossom forth in 1880 made a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
demand upon the resources of the variety houses, and
within a year threaten to leave them entirely at the
mercy of "ham-fats," as the lower order of this kind
of talent is designated. "Fun on the Bristol" and
fifty more flimsy patchworks of the same kind were
sailing around the country in a short time, and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
"team" that had a specialty act of fifteen minutes
duration wanted a play built to fit it and went around
telling friends that they guessed they'd go starring
next season. A great many of them did not go, but a
great many others did. The worst were left behind,
and the result was poor variety programmes and in
consequence poor patronage for them.</p>

<p>I picked up a programme the other day, belonging
to what was once a first-class house, and is so still in
all except the standard of the performance, and found
such old and worn-out features as a lightning crayon
artist and a lightning change artist, both of which are
so threadbare that even a ten-cent theatre wouldn't
care to give them stage room. It is an easy step from
this kind of thing down to the dives. The latter,
as an institution, flourishes wider and pays better than
places of less savory notoriety. There is such a charm
to vice that even the saintly do not hesitate to linger
in its neighborhood a while, and take a sniff of its
pungent atmosphere. Anybody who drops into Harry
Hill's place in New York, any night in the week, will
see some remarkably churchy looking gentlemen standing
around studying the aspect of the establishment
and dwelling with melting eyes upon some of the
painted faces that look up from the beer tables
ranged at one side of the hall. A correspondent who
visited Harry Hill's very recently, gives the following
description of the place, its proprietor and its frequenters:
"Harry Hill's grows bigger as its notoriety
extends with years, but it never changes. It is not a
bar-room, not a concert saloon, not a pretty waiter-girl
establishment, and not a free-and-easy. None of
these terms describe it, for it is all those things in one
and at once&mdash;big second-story room, containing a bar,
a theatrical stage, which can quickly be made into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
prize ring, a bare space for dancing, tables, seats, a
balcony, and a few so-called wine-rooms. There are
always as many women as men in the place. The
women are admitted by a private entrance, free. Men
pass through a neglected bar-room on the ground floor
at a cost of twenty-five cents. Prosperity has added a
mansard roof and a clock-tower to the original structure,
and Hill has taken in an adjoining building, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
turned its best apartments into billiard and pool-rooms
and a shooting gallery. Let us go in through the bar-room,
up a winding stair and suddenly into the glare
and bustle and merriment of the so-called theatre. On
the stage two women are exhibiting as pugilists, with
boxing-gloves, high-necked short dresses, soft, fat,
bare arms, and a futile effort to look very much in
earnest, and as if they did not realize how apparent it
was that their greatest effort was to avoid hurting one
another's breasts or bruising one another's faces.</p>

<p>"In the chairs around the tables are many men, and
an equal number of women. The men are mainly
young, and a majority seem to be country youths or store
clerks. There are others evidently country men or foreigners.
The women wear street-dress, hats and all.
They are Americans, often of Irish or German extraction.
As a rule they are not pretty, but they are
quiet and mannerly. They know the cast-iron rules
of the house&mdash;no loud or profane talking, no loud
laughing, no quarreling, "no loving." These are
printed and hang on the walls, and all who go there
either know or speedily find out that the slightest
breach of them results in prompt expulsion from the
house. All are drinking, and many of the women
are smoking big cigars or tiny cigarettes. Other
women, without hats or sacques, but wearing big
white aprons, serve as waiters and as bartenders.</p>

<p>"Harry Hill himself, a smooth-faced old man, broad,
big and muscular, who shares with Lester Wallack
the secret of looking twenty years younger than he is,
sits at a table with a detective and a chief of police
from some suburb. Hill is always there, and is ever
entertaining distinguished strangers. Clergymen from
the cities drop in at the rate of one a night. The
women, as they come and go, stop and salute or speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
with Hill. He knows them all, is kind to all, and is
liked by all. He has nothing to do with them or
their affairs, however, his place being merely their
exchange, and their duty being merely to behave
while there. The boxers bow and retire, and a young
woman, who was a few minutes before at one of the
tables with a broker, who was opening champagne,
now faces the foot-lights in a short silk skirt, bare
arms, bare head and red clogs. She sprinkles white
sand on the boards from a gilt cornucopia, the music
of a piano and three violins strike up, and she rattles
her heels and toes through a clog dance. It is a waltz
tune that she is keeping time to, and a tall young
woman of extremely haughty mien and rich apparel
seizes a shy and seedy little product of the pavement
and whirls her round and round in the bare space
on the floor. The lookers-on gather there, and a
callow stripling from the country, without previous
notice or formality, grasps a snubnosed, saucy-looking
girl in the throng and joins the dancers.</p>

<p>"'Some of these girls 'as bin a-coming 'ere ten or
fifteen years,' says Harry Hill, 'and looks better to-day
than others which left their 'omes a 'alf year ago.
Hit's hall hacordin' to 'ow they take to drink. Hif
they go too farst they're sure to go too far.'</p>

<p>"Do they reform? Well, Mr. Hill says there are
so many notions of what reform really is, that he
can't say. Some of them reform and become mistresses
when they get a chance, and some of them
reform and return and reform again by spells. He
points out one whom he calls Nellie, and says she
went away and was going to lead a strictly honest life,
disappeared for six months, and the other night came
back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
"I kept my eye on Nellie, and, needing no introduction,
seized a chance to talk with her.</p>

<p>"'I got married, and was as straight as a string for
six months,' said she; 'but I had misfortune, and
had no other way to support myself but to come back
here.'</p>

<p>"'Husband leave you?'</p>

<p>"'He got caught cracking a dry goods store, and is
up for two years.'"</p>

<p>The patrons of the variety "dives" are usually
young men, clerks, salesmen, and sometimes the
trusted employee of a bank or broker's office will get
"mashed" upon one of the almost naked women who
appear upon the stage, and will thereafter be numbered
among the patrons of the resort. Those who have
gone into the private boxes once and find the girls
obliging enough to sit on their knees and ask them to
treat will go there again if they can possibly get the
fifty cents that is asked as an admission fee.</p>

<p>Sometimes a party of really Christian men unfamiliar
with city ways will get into a variety dive by mistake,
and what is more, into the boxes. The glaring
sign over the front of the house which simply announces
that the place is a theatre attracts them to the
box-office.</p>

<p>"Say, Mister, what do you tax us to go in?" one
of the party asks.</p>

<p>"Tickets are twenty-five, thirty-five and fifty cents,"
answers the dapper little man in the box-office who
looks as if he ought to be a bar-keeper or a barber.</p>

<p>"Give us five of your half-a-dollar chairs," says the
spokesman, throwing down his money, and they are
forthwith led to seats in the private boxes, which are
no more than long galleries walled in and having two
or three windows to which the occupants crowd when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
anything interesting is going forward on the stage.
As I have already said these boxes are connected by
doors with the stage and the serio-comic vocalist who
has a few minutes to spare will loiter in to strike
somebody for a drink.</p>

<p>"Say, baby, can't I have a wet?" one of the female
wrestlers remarks as she plumps herself down in her
tights on the quivering knee of a weak little fellow who
appears young enough to be fond of molasses candy
yet, and throws her arms around his neck and hugs
him to her flabby breast violently enough to disarrange
the black curly hair he had slicked down at the barber
shop just before he came in.</p>

<p>"A what?" he asks, trying to get his neck sufficiently
released to be at least comfortable.</p>

<p>"A drink, darling," and she hugs him again and
begins playing with a little curl over his forehead.</p>

<p>"Why, of course you can," is the overwhelmed
young man's reply.</p>

<p>Now she looks fondly into his eyes and with the most
affectionate expression at her command asks: "And
how about my partner, baby. Can't she have a
drink?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," responds the victim; and there is a
loud shouting at the stage-door for "Ida," or somebody
else, and Ida, knowing what she is wanted for,
hurries to the spot. In the meantime "Johnnie," the
waiter, has been summoned.</p>

<p>"Give me a port wine sangaree," says Ida's partner.</p>

<p>"And give me a stone fence" (cider and brandy),
says Ida.</p>

<p>"And what are you going to drink, baby?" the
wrestler sitting on his knee asks.</p>

<p>"Give me glass of beer," says the "baby," in a tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
sufficiently disconsolate to suggest that he was afraid
he might not have enough money to pay for the treat.</p>

  <div class="caption">"SHE TICKLED HIM UNDER THE CHIN."</div></div>

<p>One night a party of saintly looking grangers from
Indiana,&mdash;five of them,&mdash;who appeared as if they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
a delegation to some sort of a religious convention,
got into a Bowery dive by some mistake, but
made no mistake in remaining there. They got in
early and it was late when they left. The whole thing
appeared novel, startling to them. They had never
before seen so much unstripped womanhood exposed
to the naked eye. They hired a cheap opera-glass
from the peanut boy, and they bought "pop" the
whole night long. During the first part, when all the
girls and the "nigger" end-men sit in a circle and
sing dismal songs and deal out smutty jokes, the
grangers were in a perfect ecstasy of wonder and admiration
for the shortness of the women's dresses and
the symmetry of their padded limbs; but when the
first part was over and a serio-comic singer came tripping
out upon the stage without any dress at all on&mdash;nothing
but a bodice, trunks and flesh-colored tights&mdash;and
sang "Tickled Him Under the Chin," they were
in a frenzy and did not know what to do with their
hands, or how to sit still, because the singer kept
throwing glances in the direction of their box. Then
came the supreme exaltation of their feelings; the
serio-comic danced over to the box as she sang, and actually
tickled the most clerical member of the quintette
on his fat, white chin, while the four others looked
on in astonishment, and the audience fairly howled.</p>

<p>The grangers were "guyed" pitilessly by the audience,
but they paid little, if any, attention to it. As
soon as the serio-comic had done her "turn" she
rushed for their box, and before long the five Hoosiers
were as happy as the lark when it trills its song to the
morning.</p>

  <div class="caption sans">M'LLE GENEVIEVE.</div></div>

<p>The "dive" audiences are mixed in their character,
as has been already suggested, and the proximity of a
well-dressed young man to a crowd of hoodlums in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>jeans pants and braided coats often precipitates a row.
Scarcely a night passes in the flash variety shows that
there is not some trouble. A "bouncer" is connected
with each establishment, whose business it should be
to quell disturbances, but who, like hot-headed Irish
policemen, do more towards increasing the dimensions
of a row than forty other men could do. It is bad policy
to attempt open criticism of the performers or performance
in one of these dens. A hiss will attract the attention
of the bouncer, who will come down to the
sibilant offender and <span class="locked">say:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Young man, do ye expect us to give ye Sary Burnhart
an' Fannie Divenpoort and Ed'in Booth fur
twinty-five sints. Af ye don't loike the show lave it,
but af ye open yer mug ag'in, or say so much as
'Boo,' I'll put ye fwhere ye'll have plinty toime to
cool yersel' aff."</p>

<p>If the offender dares to argue the point the
"bouncer" will catch him by the neck, and then a
struggle ensues, canes are flourished, the audience
rise to their feet, some of the girls run in fright from
the stage, and there is pandemonium in the place for
ten or fifteen minutes, by the end of which time the
"bouncer" has taken his man out, and returning to
business, triumphantly answers a question as to the
whereabouts of the <span class="locked">hisser:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Oh, I left him lyin' out there in the gutther
where the collar 'll come along an' get 'im."</p>

<p>Occasionally there will be an incident of a more
dangerous kind, but tinged slightly with romance. It
is related that a cowboy went into a variety show in
Marshal, Texas, one night and made quite a scene.
His "mash" was a "chair sweater" in the show.
Entering the place one night considerably under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
influence of brine, he called to his love in stentorian
<span class="locked">tones:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Mary, get your duds on and come with me."</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!" said Mary.</p>

<p>"Sh-h, nothing," was the lover's response. "You

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
"I'll be through in an hour," urged Mary pacifically.</p>

<p>"This show'll be out sooner than that," was the
cowboy's answer, as he pulled his barker and began
shooting the tips off the side lights. He had just
emptied his "weapin" and was about loading up
again, when the frightened audience was reassured by
the stage manager stepping on the stage and saying,
"Mary, you are excused for the remainder of the
evening. Go dress right away."</p>

<p>A "chair sweater," or "stuffer" as she is called out
West, is a girl who sits in the first part, and who has
nothing else to do than wear skirts short enough to
display her limbs, and join in the choruses if she can
do so without knocking the life out of the selection.
After the first part she sits in the boxes and "works"
the boys for drinks. If she can't make anything in the
boxes she goes out into the audience&mdash;in the lowest
of these dens&mdash;and flits from one place to another
getting a drink here, and by that time "spotting"
somebody over there whom she esteems worthy of
"striking." She keeps this up all night, until the
after-piece&mdash;the cancan, or whatever else it may be&mdash;is
reached, when she goes behind the scenes and appears
on the stage in the same street costume she has
worn out in the audience. The "chair sweater's" lot
is not a happy one. While pursuing her sudorific vocation
she innocently imagines that she is making an
actress out of herself, and I guess she is&mdash;a "dive"
actress.</p>

<p>Now and then the "chair sweater" combines her
own business with that of her employer by selling her
own or other photographs to "grays." Some of these
pictures are of the vilest kind, but they sell readily to
the patrons of the "dive," and as the sale is effected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
quietly, even an honest granger now and then buys
one, "just to show 'em up around the grocery."</p>

<p>The variety "dive" usually closes its performance
with a fiery and untamed cancan, all the people of the
company joining in the dance, the men usually in the
character costumes and "make-up" in which they
have appeared before in their sketches or acts.</p>

<p>Then follow the orgies behind the scenes. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
it is a wine supper with champagne from the bar
of the house flowing so freely that the undressed
divinities do not hesitate to empty bottle after bottle
over their heads as if they were Roman candles, thereby
giving the assemblage a shower of Mumm's Extra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
Dry; or perhaps they will shampoo the swelled head of
one of the gentlemen.</p>

<p>In the wine-room, which is an adjunct of all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
houses, and which is a place that affords seclusion to
those who want to be out of the way of meeting friends
or attracting the notice of strangers, many extraordinary
exploits are to be witnessed. Plenty of drink,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
however, is necessary to stimulate the fun, and when
the girls got an old victim into their clutches they
"play" him so nicely that he believes the whole lot
of them are in love with him, and every few minutes
comes the cry, "Let's have another bottle," and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
have it. They sit on his lap or play circus riding on
his shoulders, and until the last bottle has come, and
the victim has run dry of funds they keep him in good
humor; then they show him the door, coldly say
"Ta, ta! Baldy," and laugh heartily at his verdant
innocence as he staggers away.</p>

<p>The man who allows any of these women&mdash;these
cancan dancers or "chair sweaters"&mdash;to entice him to
their home is lost. If he has money and they know it
they will not take him to their home, but to some
lodging-house with the proprietor of which the cancan
dancer is acquainted, and whom she knows she
can trust. A pitcher of beer and a bit of drugging
for the victim's glass does the business. While she is
stroking his beard and kissing the end of his nose the
drug is flowing gently into the goblet of beer. They
drink, and in a short time the soporific has its effect,
and the slumbering man is relieved of his valuables
and cash. He appeals to the police, and they promise
to do something for him, but they don't. He sees the
cancan dancer again the next night but she knows
nothing about it. The proprietor of the lodging-house
is dumb as an oyster. All the victim can do is to
balance the account by putting experience on the debit
side of the ledger and damphoolishness on the other.</p>

<p>In New York the Bowery is the great place for these
dives. There are any number of them, and the Bowery
actress who is brazen enough to smoke her cigarettes
in the street, especially when she is "on a lark," may
be distinguished by the boldness of her face and the
almost masculine atmosphere that surrounds her. She
seems to care for nobody and nothing except her small
dog and the loafer who spends her money, and looks
upon herself as the equal of the best woman in the
profession.</p>

<p>The boy theatres which flourish in all large cities,
and which are dirty, dingy miniature places with gallery
and pit, and six by nine stages upon which the
goriest of blood-curdling dramas are enacted, have a
variety phase to them, specialty performers preceding
the dramatic representations, and half-nude women
mingling and drinking with beardless youths in the
boxes.</p>

<p>The concert saloon, as some of the low places that
have a fat German with pink-spotted shirt and stove-pipe
hat playing the piano, while a chap that has the
outward appearance of a speculative philosopher is
blowing a cyclone through a cracked cornet, is called,
has its attractions for many; and if there are ladies to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
eke out the entertainment by squeezing discord out
of an accordeon with flute obligato of an ear-piercing
and peace-destroying kind&mdash;or, in fact, if there are
any female musicians on the grounds, the proprietor
of the establishment may count on liberal patronage.
The female orchestras to be found in the Bowery,
New York, where a squad of pretty girls all dressed
in white, with a female leader wielding the baton with
as much nerve as if she were old Arditi himself, are
irresistible attractions to those whose tastes lead them
to lager beer, and who like to partake of the beverage
particularly in pleasant surroundings. A person does
not get very much beer, but he hears a great deal
of wild music, and unless he is over-sensitive he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
forgive the music and forget the beer&mdash;if he can.
It is but a few years since that the keeper of a beer
garden first introduced these institutions into American
life. His venture proved so successful that imitators
sprang up all along the Bowery. The tenements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
the East Side were explored, and every female who
could torture the neighbors with an accordeon, scrape
the catgut or bang the piano was enlisted in the grand
scheme of catering to the musical tastes of Gotham's
beer drinkers.</p>

<p>"Over the Rhine," in Cincinnati, is a great place for
cheap and vicious amusements. A correspondent writing
from there says: "The places of amusement
"Over the Rhine" line Vine Street for half a dozen
blocks. They are of the democratic and, with one
exception, rude order, more familiar to the backwoods
than to the civilization east of the Mississippi. Some
are large establishments with all the fittings of an East
Side variety theatre. Others are mere halls with a
limited stage at one end. To some an admission is
charged, ranging from ten cents up to twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
cents, but most of them are free. The performers include
many familiar stars of the variety stage, for the
salaries paid are of the best. The performances,
though vulgar, are clean enough. The drinks pay all
expenses, of course. Beer is served throughout the
house and smoking is perpetually in order. In most
places there is a gallery of boxes where the young
women from the stage mingle with such of the
audience as, by their generosity, deserve such honor.
These are "stuffers," or as they call them here "chair
warmers." One of them has conquered the soul of a
local critic and he is actually puffing her into prominence
in her peculiar line through the columns of one
of the leading papers."</p>

<span class="subhead">A TEAM OF IRISH COMEDIANS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The variety stage is responsible for a great many
theatrical "what-is-its." A few years ago there was
not so much variety to the variety business; the projectors
of mastodon and megatherian companies were
not in the field to encourage poor artists, and only the
really eminent and excellent in this branch of the
profession were allowed to inflict themselves on first-class
audiences. Now the dizziest of the throng make
their way to the foot-lights under respectable auspices
in the largest cities, and share with their really deserving
brethern, about in equal parts, the sympathy and
applause of large and fashionable houses. The different
branches of the business are, at present, subdivided
into more parts than there were formerly principal
divisions, and every new feature of the profession has
its exalted and also its insignificant exponents. There
are a hundred and one different styles of song-and-dance
men and song-and-dance women; serio-comics
are as widely variant in their styles and repertoires, as
they call the few songs they sing threadbare, as they
are numerous and diverse in their types of beauty or
ugliness; sketch artists have in their multiplicity infringed
upon the legitimate comedians, the wild burlesques,
and the highly operatic stars' territories;
there are scores and scores of schools of musical mokes
and thousands of performers with eccentric acts of one
kind or another that are intended to astonish and bewilder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
the "natives," as they call the vast number of
people who patronize their shows. But the Irish comedian
stands out amid all these changes, immutable in
his make-up and unmindful of the hoary age of the
jokes with which he tortures the intelligent portions of
his audiences. He has been dressed and redressed
and placed before the public in any number of shapes
that were intended to be novel, extending from the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
extreme of the so-called neat Irish humorist to the
other, at which stands the loud-mouthed, heel-clicking
and head-breaking North of Ireland character; but the
disguise is always thin, the efforts of the performers
are vapid, and all the comedians succeed in looking
pretty much alike, in saying the same melancholy
things, and in betraying a kinship that is unmistakable
and strongly provocative of pity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
A few performers have been successful in making
reputations as North of Ireland characters, but they
are very few. Ferguson and Mack were for a time at
the head of this class of variety comedians, but they
got lazy, failed to exhibit anything like extensive originality,
and carted their old jokes and stale "business"
to England and back, until they have fallen pretty
much to the rear ranks. Harrigan &amp; Hart, who have
a large theatre in New York, and whose play, "Squatter
Sovereignty," had a run of almost a year, are now
the best known and really the cleverest of the members
of the profession who make a specialty of Irish comedy.
Billy Barry and Hugh Fay have made fame and money
with their laughable "Muldoon's Picnic," and there
are probably a score of others whose efforts would be
worth mentioning if they could be recalled at this moment.
As in all other lines, however, the ranks have
been filled up with men and boys who are even more
ignorant and ridiculous off the stage than on; who
have graduated from newspaper hawking and boot
blacking routes to the back door of the stage, and
whose limited powers of mimicry, whose retentive
memories for old and poor jokes, and whose rhinoceros-hide
cheek&mdash;absolute "gall" they would call it
themselves&mdash;are their only recommendations to any
consideration. They, like all other really bad actors,
look down upon every brother professional and imagine
that they alone have attained to the privileged height
above which there is no firm foothold for anybody
else. It is the pleasing prerogative of all poor artists
to have hallucinations of this kind, and to dwell in
temples of fame that are built upon the sands of their
own imaginations. Nobody ever disabuses them of
their egotistical ideas, and if anybody attempted to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
so he would be set down as the very gausiest of "guys"
for his pains.</p>

<p>The Irish comedian, and especially the eccentric
gentleman who hails from the North of Ireland, has
multiplied so rapidly of late that the stock of jokes
with which the original North of Ireland comedian
started out many years ago has been turned over thousands
of times, and occasionally a modern audience
actually cry when they are made parties to the ghoulish
crime of resurrecting the dead and buried gags.
It is my intention to here present the picture of a team
of North of Ireland comedians, and give an idea of
the manner in which they amuse their audiences; for
some of the people who go to the theatre are so guileless
and so easily tickled that they find themselves
greatly amused by a dialogue teeming with ancient
Hibernianisms. The stories chosen are invariably of
the most vulgar and disgusting character, abounding
in references and suggestions that would not be listened
to outside of the theatre. The peddlers of
these rare bits of stage humor choose all manner of
make-ups to set off their stock in trade. A gorgeous
plaid suit with baggy trousers and short coat topped
by a high white hat, and the outfit completed with a
cane; or a wardrobe consisting of a semi-respectable
thin-sleeved, square-tailed frock coat and high-water
broadcloth pants, with polished and towering
stove-pipe hat; or a hod-carrier's rig; or any half-idiotic
attempt to duplicate a workingman's get-up&mdash;a
"gas-house tarrier," who tells you about Micky
Duffy having got a job to wheel out smoke or to suck
wind from bladders,&mdash;any of these may be chosen.
The clothes may differ, but the jokes, the "business,"
and the facial pictures will always be found the same.
Canes and stove-pipe hats&mdash;white or black&mdash;are even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
more necessary for the success of an Irish comedian
than is talent of any kind; the canes are used for
thumping the floor of the stage, and the stove-pipe
hats for banging each other in the face, for this class
of comedians always travel in pairs. There is a great
deal of floor-thumping and hat-slapping in one of their
acts, and among the rough acrobatic aspirants to fame
the feet are freely used upon each other, and there is
a reckless lot of falling and tumbling in breakneck
style upon the stage.</p>

<p>In making up his face the Irish comedian generally
likes to indulge in a shrubbery of beard around the
neck under either a clean shaven or stubble-strewn
chin; if he aims at anything like decency in his appearances
he will affect only brushy side-whiskers. A
red expression around the nose and under the eyes,
and a red or black wig to match his special eccentricity,
complete his needs in this respect. The two specimens
of Irish comedians that I have chosen for presentation
here were of the alleged neat type in their
profession. They were travelling with Tony Pastor
when I saw them, and in their outward aspect greatly
resembled Harry and Johnny Kernell. They were
credited with holding a high position in their particular
line, and their names were on the walls and fences
in letters a foot long; in addition to this they came on
late in the programme, which is always a sure indication
of the importance of the estimate placed on an
act or artist by the management.</p>

<p>But here comes one of them. The Stein Sisters
have just finished a song-and-dance, "the flat," for
the street scene comes together, the orchestra with a
wild flourish of bass drum and cornet strikes up a
familiar Irish melody, and, after a few bars, one of the
comedians enters. He is tall, wears a gray woollen suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
of fashionable cut, a hat that never in the world would
sit on an Irish head; a red-haired wig, partly bald, is
secured under the hat; gaiters with black over-gaiters
clothe the feet, and the face is smooth and genteel,
except upon the chin, whence a long thin beard protrudes
like a plowshare. An ordinary twenty-five-cent
cane puts the finishing touches to his wardrobe. He
looks like a hack-driver out for a holiday, or a Kerry
Patch politician dressed for a Skirmishing Fund picnic.
He faces the audience from the middle of the lower part
of the stage as boldly as if he were going to entertain
them with something new. He pretends to be angry,
and when the music has ceased, begins to pace wildly
up and down the front of the stage, as he shouts regardless
of all the rules of common sense and <span class="locked">elocution:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"The oidea av callin' me a tarrier! Why a Spanyard
can't walk the shtreets nowadays widout bein'
taken for a Mick or a tarrier!"</p>

<p>There are always a few indiscreet people in the
audience who laugh at this sally, and the comedian
goes on: "But there's no use talkin', my b'y's bad as
the rest av 'em. Whin he wint away from home, two
years ago, he sez to me, sez he: 'Father, whin you
hear from me ag'in I'll be President av the United
States.' I got a letter from him last week sayin' he was
wan av the foinest shoemakers in the State's prison."
This also raises a laugh, and he continues: "But
there's nawthin' but trouble in this wurrld. The
other day I bought a horse, and the man tould me
he'll throt a mile in two minits; and be heavens he
could do it only fur wan thing&mdash;the disthance is too
much fur the toime. [Laughter by the audience.]
I'm railly ashamed ivery toime I take that animal out
a roidin', fur I've got to put a soign upon him sayin',<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
'This is a horse.' [Laughter.] My woife an' her
mother tuck the horse out fur a droive in the park the
other day; the horse run away, the buggy upsot, an'
my woife and mother-in-law war thrun out an' kilt.
Now, whether you belave me or not, more than five
hundred married min have bin afther me thryin' to b'y
that horse. [Laughter by the male portion of the audience.]
But I won't sell him, because I'm thinkin'
av gettin' married ag'in meself. [Laughter.] I've
got a gerrl&mdash;she's a swate crayther av sixteen summers,
several hard winters [titter], and I think she's
put in a couple av hard falls [laughter]; but she'll
spring up ag'in all right. [Loud and indiscriminate
laughter.] I tuck her to the shlaughter-house the
other day to see 'em kill hogs. She wuz watchin' 'em
butcher the poor craythers whin all to wonst she turns
to me an' sez, sez she, 'Whin'll yure turn come, dear
John?' [Laughter.] We're married now. My woife
is very fond of cats. Three weeks ago she axed me to
make her a prisint av wan, and I tuck wan home.
That noight the cat got into my woife's bed-chamber,
got into the bed, sucked her breath, and in the mornin'
my woife was dead. The other noight I wint out an'
got dhrunk, wint home and got in bed; the same cat
kem and sucked my breath, and be heavens! whither
ye belave me or not, in the mornin' the cat was
dead!"</p>

<p>There are many persons in the audience who seem
not to have read this story in the original Greek,&mdash;for
it appears among the queer things Hierokles, the Joe
Miller of ancient times, wrote,&mdash;and these persons
laugh at the ghastly joke, while the orchestra gives a
chord, and the comedian, tilting his hat forward, flourishing
his cane and walking around the stage with the
air of a man who has done an act of charity of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>

<p class="in0">Or some equally nonsensical and jingling lines, after
which he dances a few steps and hurriedly exits. As
he is going off at one side his partner comes on at the
opposite side with another armful of "chestnuts"&mdash;as
they call worn-out gags, in the show business. The
partner is known as Solomon O'Toole. He is dressed
in square-cut frock coat, high vest, and short pantaloons,
has a squatty, white, square-top, stiff hat, side-whiskers,&mdash;"Galway
sluggers" or "Carolinas" they
are usually called,&mdash;carries a cane, and altogether
from the expression of his face seems a quiet and

<p>"Now, I'm a man can shtand a joak, but whin I go
into a barber shop on Sunday mornin' and the colored
barber pins a newspaper under me chin an' hands me
a towel to read, its goin' a little too far. [Laughter.]
But whin a man goes out in the mornin', these days,
there's no knowin' whether or not he'll come back
ag'in at night. The other day I went to see a friend
o' moine named John Gilligan, who lives at Newton
Stuart, about tin moile from Poketown, on the Hog
an' Hominy Road, an' he tuck me to hear a South
Caroliny pr'acher who was pr'achin' an eloquint sarmin.
Everything wint all roight until the pr'acher
sez, sez he, "When God med the fust man he stud
him up ag'inst a fince to dhry!" I hollered out, "Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
med the fince?" an' be heavens, they bounced me on
the impulse av the momint. [Laughter.] But az I
sed afore, whin a man goes out in the mornin' he never
knows what's goin' to happen. The other mornin'
I wint over to the Grand Paycific Hotel&mdash;I go there
every mornin'; there's a friend av mine boardin'
there be the waik, an' whin he laves town I go over an'
ate his males for him; but I wint over there th' other
mornin' an' picked up a paper an' I read an arteckle
headed 'The Chinaise Must Go.' Now, be heavens,
I don't want the fellow that's got my three shurrts to
go until I git 'em back from him ag'in. [Laughter.]
A friend av moine named Gilligan bought a goat the
other day, an' he goes about the shtreets atin' eysthercans
an' knockin' the childher over in the gutter. He
butted over a little nagur b'y th' other mornin', and
whin Gilligan was taken to coort he summoned me as
a witness for the prosecution. Whin I tuck the witness
shtand the judge axed me what me name waz, an'
I sed Michael Mahoney; an' he axed me what war me
nationality, whin be way av a joak I sez, sez I,
'I-talyan,' an' be heavens, he gev me six months for
perjuree. [Laughter.] I wint into a salune th' other
day; some av the b'ys war settin' around a table
playin' cassinoe, an' whin they saw me come in, one
av 'em sez, sez he, 'Luck out for the Mick, or he'll
swipe up all the lunch!' [Laughter.] I've got a
b'y that the Chicago base-ball club used for a foul
flag on rainy days. [Smiles.] They threw a ball to
him th' other day an' hit him in th' eye; I tuck him
to an occulist who tuck the eye out an' laid it on a
table; be heavens, a cat kem along an' swallied the
eye. [Smiles.] The docthor tould me to kum
around next day, an' I tuck the b'y wid me. The
occulist had cut out wan av his cat's eyes, an' he puts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
it into the b'ys head. [Audible smiles.] Now the
b'ys doin' fust rate, only whin he goes to bed at
noight wan eye stez open an' keeps roamin' around fur
rats. [Laughter.] Gilligan has got two b'ys. Wan
av thim hasn' spint a cint fur two year; he'll be out
(of prison) in October. [Laughter.] The other b'y
will make his mark in the world; in fact he med his
mark on me the other noight. He put a tack on a
chair with the belligerint ind to'rds me, an' whin I
wint to sit down I got up ag'in very suddintly. I
don't care how ould a man is, or how tired he is, whin
he sits down on the belligerint ind av a tack he is
bound to assoom agility an' youthfulness. [Laughter.]
It may be but a momentary assumption, but the agility
is always there. The other mornin' I intered a friend's
salune. There war grape shkins on the flure, an' I
sez to him, 'How do ye do, Mr. Cassidy? I see you
had a party last night.' 'What makes you think
so?' sez he. 'Because I see the grape shkins on the
flure,' sez I. 'Thim's not grape shkins,' sez he;
'thim's eyes. Some of the b'ys hed a fight here lasht
noight an' you're now surveyin' the battle-field.'
[Laughter.] But I was expectin' a friend av moine
down here, Levi McGinnis. Ah, here he comes.
Levi, how are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm well, Solomon," says the other, who has come
on the stage and is shaking hands with Solomon.
"What kept you so quick?"</p>

<p>"I'd been here sooner," is the smart response,
"only I couldn't get down any later."</p>

<p>"It waz a very wet winther we had lasht winther,
Solomon?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did you buy any rubbers yet this year?"</p>

<p>"Not this year."</p>

<p>"Goodyear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
"Where did you go when you left me th' other
noight?" Levi continues.</p>

<p>"I went down to the maskeerade ball."</p>

<p>"I heard you was there. They put you out because
you wouldn't take your mask off after 12 o'clock."</p>

<p>"But I didn't have any mask on. It waz me own
face."</p>

<p>"That's what I tould them," says Levi, "but they
wouldn't belave me."</p>

<p>This raises a laugh. Solomon looks for a moment
with astonishment at Levi, then thumps his cane
against the floor in an angry manner, and walks in a
circle around the stage as if terribly disgusted at
having allowed himself to be sold. This look, cane-thumping
and walk-around are stereotyped Hibernianisms,
and are introduced at the end of each "sell."
As Solomon O'Toole gets sold all the time this end
of the business is as exclusively his as if he had a
patent on it.</p>

<p>"I went into a salune this mornin'," said Solomon,
"to git a glass av beer. I got me beer, ped foive
sints, and waz jist goin' to blow the foam off it when
somebody cries out, 'Foight!' I laid down me beer
an' run out the dure to see where the foight waz, but
there was no foight. Whin I got back me beer waz
gone. I called for another glass an' waz goin' to
dhrink it down, when somebody shouts, 'Foire!'
Now I wanted to see the foire an' I didn't want to
lose me beer, so I pulls out a bit av pincil an' paper
an' wroites on it, 'I have shpit in this beer.' When
I puts the paper on tap av the beer an' wint out to see
the foire. There was no foire, an' what do you think
happin'd whin I got back?"</p>

<p>"Your beer waz gone," said Levi.</p>

<p>"No it wazn't," Solomon interposed. "The beer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
waz there an' the bit av paper waz on tap av it, but
some sucker had wrote roight ander my wroitin', 'So
hev I.'"</p>

<p>The conclusion of the story is of course greeted with
laughter.</p>

<p>"Here, Solomon," says Levi, "I want to make
you a prisent."</p>

<p>"An' what's this?" Asks Solomon, examining the
article that has been handed to him.</p>

<p>"A shoe horn."</p>

<p>"An' what do I want wid an ould shoe horn?"</p>

<p>"Thry an' get your hat on your head with it" answers
Levi, amid an outburst of merriment from the
audience.</p>

<p>"How long can a man live widout brains?" is
Solomon's next conundrum.</p>

<p>"I don't know," says Levi. "How ould are you
now?" [Laughter.]</p>

<p>"What is a plate of hash?" Levi asks.</p>

<p>"An insult to a square meal," Solomon answers
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Thin you can shtand more insults than any other
man I ever saw," says Levi, whereat Solomon's indignation
causes him to manœuvre to the right of stage
in proper position for the next question.</p>

<p>"What's the diff'rence betwane you and a jackass?"
he asks, looking sternly at Levi.</p>

<p>The latter measures the floor with his eye, and answers,
"About twelve foot." Solomon thumps his
cane against the floor once more, looks bereft of all
the pleasure he ever possessed on earth, and moving up
to Levi, <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"No, that's not the roight answer."</p>

<p>"Well," says Levi, "I'd loike to know what is the
diff'rince betwane you an' a jackass?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
"No diff'rince," shouts Solomon, throwing up his
hands, and coming down the stage shaking with laughter.
Suddenly the fact dawns upon him that he has made
a mule of himself. His face assumes a bewildered expression,
and he hastily returns from the scene followed
by Levi McGinnis, while the orchestra strikes
up a lively air in anticipation of the encore which is to
call the comedians out to do a wild Irish reel.</p>

<p>This is a fair sample of the dialogue indulged in by
a team of Irish comedians of average ability, and the
reader will at once understand from it what ridiculous
and almost disgusting language and incidents
are made use of to raise a laugh, and how very easy it
is to please a variety theatre audience. Pat Rooney's
shrug of the shoulders and Land-League phiz, or somebody
else's queer walk becomes the rage, and immediately
there are a hundred weak and pitiful imitators.
So, too, with such a dialogue as the foregoing; it
seems to "catch on" with the public, and every Irish
comedian on the stage must appropriate at least a portion
of it,&mdash;and usually the very worst portion. It
is safe to assume that the variety stage to-day has
no so-called North of Ireland Irishman who does not
fling at least a half-dozen of the sorry witticisms I have
here given, at the heads of his audience. There is no
law against it,&mdash;no protection for the patrons of the
theatres, who can do nothing else than to grin and
stand it,&mdash;and therefore the Irish comedian and his
"chestnuts" forever flourish in this land of the free
and home of the brave.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BLACK ART.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The black art, as the art of magic is termed, has
arrived at a degree of perfection that is amazing.
The magicians of the Orient for a long time were held
up as superior to any rivals outside their country.
They sat in the streets, and without paraphernalia
caused flowers to burst from pots of earth and spring
into instantaneous growth; they had their then wonderful
basket trick, in which a boy, having entered a basket,
to all appearances just large enough to receive him, remained
there while the magician ran his sword through
the basket in all directions, after which the boy came
forth unharmed; there were sword swallowers among
them, and altogether their skill in and knowledge of
the art of mystifying was considered beyond reproach.
The Chinese, too, profess to be good jugglers and
magicians, and so they are. But the Europeans and the
Americans have stepped in, and the Hindoo and the
Chinaman may now go to the rear in magic. Houdin,
Heller, Macallister, and Hermann have done tricks far
superior to anything the Eastern wonder-workers are
capable of, either in the way of mechanical intricacy or
manual dexterity. The latter feature is cultivated entirely,
and you no longer see the magician's stage covered
high and low with glittering paraphernalia, whose
brightness was beautifully set off by the black velvet
hangings in the background. Now there is nothing
presented to the view of the audience except a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
table in the centre of the stage. Taking Mr. Hermann,
for example: This magician comes out in full evening
dress, with coat sleeves pushed back revealing his
immaculate shirt cuffs and gorgeous sleeve buttons.
Whatever articles he will inject into his tricks he carries
in the capacious pockets of his coat or in the
palm of his hand. He introduces himself pleasantly
to the audience in his broken English, and at once the
performance begins. From that time on until the last
illusion is given the audience remains in darkness as
to his methods. He seldom leaves the stage, going
only up to the last entrance, where, by standing
against the projecting wing his confederate can fill his
pockets with what he needs. A magician's coat looks
like a very common-place effort at the swallow-tail article.
That's all it is exteriorly, but if you get a
glimpse of the side the lining is on, you will find from
eight to a dozen large and small pockets in the garment.
Two of the pockets are huge affairs, running
from the front edge back under the arms, thus leaving
a wide mouth, so that large articles can quickly be
dropped into them.</p>

<p>Hermann is a great trickster, not only on the
stage, but off. He walked into a barber-shop in Memphis
one day, went up to the place where the razors
were kept, and taking up one, calmly cut his throat,
standing before the glass after the gash had been
made, and with evident pleasure regarding the profuse
flow of blood from the wound. The barbers and their
customers ran wildly into the streets yelling like a
tribe of Feejees around a barbecue of roast missionary.
They called the police, and raised a small riot in their
immediate neighborhood. The police came and entered
the shop, only to find Hermann coming forward to
greet them, laughing and remarking that it was only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
little practical joke. There was not the slightest sign
of any wound upon his throat, and it was only when
the barbers were told that it was Hermann, the magician,
that they could be brought to believe that he had
not really cut his throat through, and then by some
wonderful healing art closed the gap again.</p>

<div id="ip_139" class="figcenter" style="width: 268px;">
  <img src="images/i_432.jpg" width="268" height="361" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">HERMANN'S "SELL."</div></div>

<p>During his engagement in New York last season,
the famous magician demoralized a waiter and the
proprietor of a German beer saloon by making the
foaming glass appear and disappear, and in receiving
the accurate change of a five-dollar note counted it before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
the chagrined proprietor and made it appear that
the amount returned was $12, which he coolly pocketed.
But his best trick was the "sell" he perpetrated
on the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children. He had it announced that he would resume
his old feat of blowing a child from a cannon,
and making it appear safe and sound in the gallery of
the theatre. This set the society in arms at once.
He was notified that if he tried it the child (an apprentice)
would be taken from him. He replied that he
was going to rehearse the feat on Thursday morning,
anyhow; whereupon an agent of the society, with a
writ of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">habeas corpus</i>, rushed upon the scene. Just
as he was about to ram the child into the piece of
heavy ordnance aimed at the gallery of the Grand
Opera House, the agent seized it and a tussel ensued
between him and the magician. In the pulling and
hauling one of the legs of the disputed youngster came
off, and it was discovered that it was only a gigantic,
well-made-up doll. The agent escaped amid roars of
laughter, leaving his trophy behind. The press, too,
had been sold by the trick, so none of the papers published
the item.</p>

<p>Much as Hermann has sold others, he has been pretty
badly sold himself. I remember one night while Hermann
was playing South, and doing his cabinet trick,
some of the boys around the theatre put up a job on
him that resulted disastrously as far as the trick was
concerned. The cabinet is a large contrivance greatly
resembling the huge refrigerators in use in grocery
stores, and some who know, say, bearing a great resemblance
to saloon refrigerators. It has a false back
and is so constructed that one or more persons may be
hidden in the rear compartment. In the trick Hermann
makes use of two colored boys, who must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
alike in size and facial appearance. Only one of the
boys figures in the trick at first, going through a funny
bit of play and dialogue with the magician, until at
last he leaves the stage to get a knife with which to
combat a big monkey that has been locked up in the
cabinet. When boy No. 1 goes off the stage for a
knife boy No. 2 comes back with it and is hurriedly
pushed into the cabinet. Meanwhile boy No. 1 has
left the stage-door and is running fast as he can around
the block. The magician after standing at the cabinet
a few minutes&mdash;just long enough to allow boy No. 1
to get to the front entrance of the theatre&mdash;opens the
door, and lo! boy No. 2 is gone. "Boyee! Boy-ee!"
the magician shouts, "Say boy-ee w'ere are you,
boy-ee?" "Here I is, boss," the boy shouts, rushing
breathlessly up the aisle. The trick surprises
everybody, and is a good one. On the occasion I refer
to, the "boys" got a policeman to arrest the lad
while he was running around from the back to the
front door. The blue-coat took him to the station and
Hermann shouted in vain for his "boy-ee," and was
finally obliged to close the trick without the appearance
of his darkey confederate.</p>

<p>As I have spoken above about the jugglers and
tricksters of the Orient I may as well say that I witnessed
the performances of the trickster who was in
Harry French's Hindoo troupe. There was nothing
marvellous in his feats, the boy-and-basket trick alone
being the only thing of an astonishing character that
he presented, and that being susceptible of easy explanation,
the boy being light and supple and capable of
moving or contracting his body so as to keep out of
the way of the sword thrusts, which by the way were
not of a violent character. In a private entertainment
given by this juggler he appeared more awkward and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
clumsier than many an amateur who undertakes to furnish
a parlor entertainment for his friends. It was
evident that he would undergo suffering and pain for
the success of a trick, as he took an ordinary wooden
tooth-pick and while pretending to push it, in its entirety,
into one corner of his eye, actually did push
part of it in, not having broken it off short enough in
the process of concealing it. Again he swallowed a
yard of black thread, and taking a knife cut a small
opening in his side and brought forth a yard of black
thread that had, of course, been concealed there beforehand.
The thread was bloody and was drawn slowly
from its place of concealment.</p>

<p>A correspondent writing from China about the street
jugglers to be seen there, says: "Sword-swallowing
and stone-eating appear to be the commonest feats,
and operators of this description may be found in
almost every street. One fellow, however, performed
a number of feats in front of our hotel, which demand
from me more than a passing notice. He stationed
himself in the middle of the street, and having blown
a bugle-blast to give warning that he was about to
begin his entertainment, he took a small lemon or
orange tree, which was covered with fruit, and balanced
it upon his head. He then blew a sort of chirruping
whistle, when immediately a number of rice
birds came from every direction, and settled upon the
boughs of the bush he balanced or fluttered about his
head. He then took a cup in his hand, and began to
rattle some seeds in it, when the birds disappeared.
Taking a small bamboo tube, he next took the seeds
and putting, one in it blew it at one of the fruit, when
it opened and out flew one of the birds, which fluttered
about the circle surrounding the performer. He
continued to shoot the seeds at the oranges until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
nearly a dozen birds were released. He then removed
the tree from his forehead, and setting it down, took
up a dish, which he held above his head, when all the
birds flew into it, then covered it over with a cover,
and giving it a whirl or two about his head, opened it
and displayed a quantity of eggs, the shells of which
he broke with a little stick, releasing a bird from each
shell. The trick was neatly performed, and defied
detection from my eyes. The next trick was equally
astonishing and difficult of detection. Borrowing a
handkerchief from one of his spectators, he took an
orange, cut a small hole in it, then squeezed all the juice
out, and crammed the handkerchief into it. Giving
the orange to a bystander to hold, he caught up a
teapot and began to pour a cup of tea from it, when
the spout became clogged. Looking into the pot,
apparently to detect what was the matter, he pulled
out the handkerchief and returned it to the owner.
He next took the orange from the bystander and cut it
open, when it was found to be full of rice."</p>

<p>Two of the finest tricks now on the stage are the
ærial suspension and the Indian box-trick. The latter
I explain in the next chapter. The ærial suspension,
which is best seen in Prof. Seeman's performances,
consists in apparently mesmerizing a young lady
while she is standing on a stool between two upright
bars, upon each of which she rests an elbow. When
she is in the mesmeric state the stool is removed,
leaving her suspended upon both elbows; then one
of the bars&mdash;that under the left elbow&mdash;is removed,
and the fair subject still remains motionless, her entire
weight resting upon the elbow of the right arm, which
is extended out from the body, with the hand thrown
easily and gracefully against the cheek. Next, her
figure is pushed out from the bar through various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
angles, until at last she reclines upon her strange
ærial couch, which is scarcely more than one
inch in diameter. The illusion is a beautiful one,
and astonishes all who see it. Occasionally the
creaking of the steel joints under the elbow is heard
out in the audience, "giving away" the feat, for the
actual fact is that the young lady is not in a mesmeric
condition, but is held in position by a steel armor
worn under her costume, with a joint at the elbow
that fits into the upright bar, where a powerful system
of leverage holds the body in any position desired.</p>

<p>Hermann's bird trick is a fine one. He comes before
the audience with a living bird in a small cage
held between both hands, and "Wan! Two! T'ree!"
with a sudden movement, and without turning away
from the audience spreads his arms, when, lo! the bird
and cage have disappeared. The explanation given by
some is that the cage is made of rubber, which, when
released envelopes the bird in a sort of sack which
flies up the magician's sleeve.</p>

<p>Nearly every young man in the land who has seen
a magician on the stage, wants to master the black
art. It is very easy for him to do so. All he needs
is a great deal of what is vulgarly known as "cheek,"
and termed in theatrical slang, "gall," a quick eye,
and ease and rapidity of movement in handling articles.
The first thing to be learned is the art of "palming"&mdash;concealing
small objects in the palm of the hand.
Coins, balls, handkerchiefs, etc., are hidden in this
way, being held in the open hand by the pressure of
the fleshy part of the thumb. In this way the shower
of coin and many like tricks are done. When the art
of "palming" is understood, rapidity of movement is
the next thing, and then come the mechanical and
other tricks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
Only the old-school magicians&mdash;the fakirs&mdash;retain
the fire-eating trick in their entertainments. Any
school-boy can do it now, as the preparation for it is
very simple. By anointing the tongue with liquid
storax, a red-hot poker may be licked cool, or coals taken
from the fire may be placed upon the tongue and left
there until they become black. To any person who
has an appetite for flames, or for whom five-cent
whiskey is not fiery enough, a trial of this trick will be
gratifying. And should there be a desire to walk on
fire or on red-hot iron, let the aspiring salamander
take half an ounce of camphor, dissolve it in two ounces
of aqua vitæ, add to it one ounce of quicksilver, one
ounce of liquid storax, which is the droppings of myrrh,
and prevents the camphor from firing; take also two
ounces of hematis, which is red stone, to be had at the
druggist's. Let them beat it to a powder in their
great mortar, for being very hard it cannot well be reduced
in a small one; add this to the ingredients already
specified, and when the walking is to be done
anoint the feet with the preparation, when the trick
may be accomplished without the slightest danger.</p>

<p>If anybody desires to be ghastly in his trickery, he
may cut a man's head off and put it in a platter a yard
from his body. This is done by causing a board, a
cloth, and a platter to be purposely made with holes in
each to fit a boy's neck. The board must be made of
two planks, the longer and broader the better; there
must be left within half a yard of the end of each plank
half a hole, that both the planks being put together,
there may remain two holes like those in a pair of
stocks. There must be made, likewise, a hole in the
cloth; a platter having a hole of the same size in the
middle, and having a piece taken out at one side the
size of the neck, so that he may place his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
above; must be set directly over it; then the boy
sitting or kneeling under the board must let the head
only remain upon the board in the frame. To make
the sight more dreadful, put a little brimstone into a
chafing-dish of coals, and set it before the head of the
boy, who must gasp two or three times that the smoke
may enter his nostrils and mouth, and the head presently
will appear stark dead, and if a little blood be
sprinkled on his face, the sight will appear more
dreadful. This is commonly practised with boys instructed
for that purpose. At the other end of the
table, where the other hole is made, another boy of the
same size as the first boy must be placed, his body on
the table and his head through the hole in the table,
at the opposite end to where the head is which is exhibited.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE INDIAN BOX-AND-BASKET TRICK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Indian box-and-basket trick was for a long time
a mystery even among magicians, and now it puzzles
astute people to understand how the young man or
young woman who has been tied in a sack and placed
under lock and key in a wicker basket on top of a box
not only locked and sealed but tied in all directions
with stout rope, can get out of the sack and basket
and into the box within very few minutes. In 1873
Barnum paid £1,000 to a London trickster for the so-called
mystery. This extraordinary feat which puzzled
the knowing ones for so long a time was explained
to me once by a magician, and will be found so simple
as to astonish those who read the explanation.</p>

  <img src="images/i_441b.jpg" width="219" height="223" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><i>Fig. 3.</i></div></div>

<p>The magician begins by announcing the trick; he
then brings on
the stage a large
wooden box-like
trunk (<a href="#ip_140">Fig. 1</a>)
with hinges and
hasps on it. A
committee is
generally called from the audience to examine
the box to see that there is no deception in its
apparent stoutness. They look it over and over and
discover nothing. They then lock the box, retain the
keys, and stop up the key-holes with sealing-wax. The
committee also, amid the shouts of the audience to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
"tie it up tight," wind rope around the box in all directions,
making innumerable knots and using every
effort to secure the box firmly. Then on top of the
box is placed a board about as wide as the lid of the
box, and on the opposite ends of which are heavy
plate staples.
(<a href="#ip_141">Fig. 2</a>.) The
magician's
assistant now
steps to the foot-lights and is introduced to the crowd
he, or she, is to astonish. A sack is brought forward,
the assistant lightly mounts to the board on top of the
box, gets into the sack, within which there is generally
a stool, so that the person inside may sit down. The
magician begins to tie up the sack; he gathers the top
of it in his hands, and in the meantime the assistant
thrusts through the opening a portion of another sack,
and with his hands over his head holds in place the
gathered end of the sack in which he is concealed
while the magician ties a rope around the false end.
The basket is a
high, conical-shaped
wicker affair,
with a heavy
ring around its
mouth and two
large staples at
opposite sides.
(<a href="#ip_142">Fig. 3</a>.) When
the basket is
placed over the
assistant, the staples
in its ring
fit exactly over
those on the
board above the box; padlocks are passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
the staples and locked, the committee hold the
key, and sealing-wax is again applied to the keyhole.
The trick is now ready, the magician draws
a screen across to hide the box and basket from the
audience, and usually within two minutes the signal is
given that the feat has been accomplished. Sometimes
this signal is a pistol shot; at other times a whistle.
The screen is thrown aside, the seals on the locks are
unbroken; everything is in exactly the position in which
the committee left it, the ropes remain securely tied,
seem undisturbed, and on opening the box, which is
still stout and innocent-looking as ever, the assistant
tumbles out and the trick comes to an end amid the
wild plaudits of the audience and an occasional uncomplimentary
hoot at the committeemen.</p>

<div id="ip_143" class="figright" style="width: 125px;">
  <img src="images/i_442.jpg" width="125" height="60" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><i>Fig. 4.</i></div></div>

<p>How is it done? The simple-looking contrivance
that forms the foundation of the mystery is nothing
more or less than a trick-box. Along the edges of the
front, back and ends are fastened stout battens, as can
be seen in the cut. These battens are screwed to the
boards which form the upper part of the box. The
lower boards at front and back and both ends are simply
sliding panels. The parts of these panels which
come directly behind the battens are filled with iron
plates pierced with holes of the shape to be seen in
<a href="#ip_143">Fig. 4</a>. The screws on the lower
parts of the batten are dummies&mdash;that
is, they go only partly
through the battens, and do
not reach the panels. On the
inner sides of the battens are iron plates, each carrying
a stud, so that when the parts of the panel plates
marked <i>A</i> come directly opposite the studs of the battens,
the panel, if pressed or pushed, will fall inside
the box; but if the studs be pressed through <i>A</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
the panels shoved along so that the shanks of the studs
slide through the slatted parts, <i>B</i>, the panels will be
locked securely. The unsuspicious air-holes you see
in the panels are there for a purpose; the performer
uses them to give him a purchase, so that either with
his fingers or by means of a small iron rod he may
slide the panels backward or forward.</p>

<div id="ip_144" class="figright" style="width: 119px;">
  <img src="images/i_443.jpg" width="119" height="156" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><i>Fig. 5.</i></div></div>

<p>There is another piece of trickery in the construction
of the board that rests on the box and upon which
the basket is placed. The plate staples are "crooked;"
that is, the staples are not of a piece with the plates,
but are separate; they are made with a shoulder, and
on each of the ends which fit tightly into holes through
the plates, there is an oval-shaped hole, as shown in
<a href="#ip_144">Fig. 5</a>. Inside the board are two
double bolts which pass through
these holes and keep the staples
in place. The person under the
basket passes a thin steel blade
between the boards and slides
back the bolts at one end. He
then lifts the basket, and with it
the staple. Once outside the
basket he replaces it against the
staple in the plate, pushes it
down, its rounded ends acting like wedges to
pushing the bolts back, which come together again
through the oval holes of the staple, locking it
firmly to the board again. All that remains to be
done, then, is to slide the panel of the box, push it
in, creep through the closely woven ropes and inside
the box, put the panel back in its place and the trick
is at an end.</p>

<p>Occasionally a performer does not find it as easy to
do this trick as it reads here. He may sometimes get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
stuck in the basket, or may find it impossible to get
into the box. The sack is no trouble to him at all,
for he is never really tied in the sack,&mdash;all he has to
do is to crawl out of it. Carabgraba, I think it was,
while exhibiting the Indian box-trick in Chicago at the
Adelphi Theatre, in 1874, met with an accident that
set the house in an uproar, and came near precipitating
a panic. His assistant, who had succeeded in getting
out of the basket, snapped in two a small iron rod
he used for sliding the panel, and despite a long and
desperate effort could not succeed in opening the box.
All he could do was to come from behind the screen,
walk to the foot-lights and beg to be excused. An
expert rope-tier had secured the box, as one of the
committee called upon to do so, and the audience crediting
the expert with the failure of the trick, cried
fraud, and grew greatly excited. They would listen
to no explanation until Leonard Grover, then manager
of the Adelphi, came forward and promised that the
trick would be performed later in the evening, and
that, in the meantime, the box should remain in full
sight of the audience, both of which promises were
faithfully kept.</p>

<p>As it always takes some time to do this trick, the
magician has some kind of a "ghost story" fixed up
to entertain his audience. An old ex-conjurer, writing
in <i>Scribner's Monthly</i> on the subject, gave the following
talk, with which he usually diverted his patrons
while his assistant was getting into the <span class="locked">box:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"And <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">apropos</i> of spiritualism," I would say, "I
will, with your permission, relate the adventure of a
servant girl at a spiritual seance. Miss Honora Murphy,
a young female engaged in the honorable and
praiseworthy occupation of general housework merely
to dispel <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i>, not hearing in some time from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
'b'y at home' to whom she was engaged to be
'marrid,' was advised by the 'gerrl next doore'
to consult the spirits. Miss Murphy objected at first
on the ground that she had taken her 'Father
Matchew seventeen year afore in her parish church
at home an' niver drunk sperrits,' but finally concluded
to follow the advice. The result I shall give
you as detailed by her to her <span class="locked">friend:"&mdash;</span></p>

"'For what?' says I.</p>

<p>A story like this gives the magician's assistant plenty
of time to work the trick. Sometimes a magician
whose confidence in his assistant is not strong, or
whose paraphernalia is limited, will have only the box,
and will satisfy himself with merely "tying" his assistant
in a sack on top of the box. This way the
trick is surer and a great deal easier than when the
basket is used.</p>

<span class="subhead">VENTRILOQUISM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>All who have heard Prof. Kennedy or Val Vose
with their funny little figures have wondered how they
managed to produce such an effect upon their audience&mdash;to
completely delude them into the belief
that the speech came from the moving lips of the little
wooden heads and not from the closed and motionless
labials of the ventriloquists. Both gentlemen are
thoroughly familiar with their art, and the entertainment
they give may be taken as a sample of the possibilities
of ventriloquism. The history of the art goes
back to Biblical times, but not until the eighteenth century
have we anecdotes of the remarkable performances
of men endowed with the gift. The earliest notice of
the illusion, as carried out in modern times, has reference
to Louis Brabant <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">valet de chambre</i> to Francis I.
Having been rejected by the parents of a rich heiress
he wished to wed, he waited until the father was dead;
then he visited the widow, whom he caused to hear
the voice of her husband coming from above commanding
her to give their daughter in marriage to
Louis, that he (the father) might be relieved from purgatory.
The widow was only too glad to comply.
Now, Louis wanted a wedding portion, so he went to
one Cornu, a rich, miserly, and usurious banker at
Lyons, whom he terrified into giving him ten thousand
crowns by the old trick of parent and purgatory.</p>

<p>The works of M. L'Abbe La Chapelle, issued 1772,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
contain descriptions of the ventriloquial achievements
of Baron Mengen at Vienna; and those of M. St. Gille,
near Paris, are equally interesting and astonishing.
The former ingeniously constructed a doll with movable
lips, which he could readily control by a movement of
the fingers under the dress; and with this automaton
he was accustomed to hold humorous and satirical dialogues.
He ascribed proficiency in his art to the frequent
gratification of a propensity for counterfeiting
the cries of the lower animals, and the voices of persons
with whom he was in contact.</p>

<p>La Chapelle, having heard many surprising circumstances
related concerning one M. St. Gille, a grocer
at St. Germainen-Laye, near Paris, whose powers as a
ventriloquist had given occasion to many singular and
diverting scenes, formed the resolution of seeing him.
Being seated with him on the opposite side of a fire, in a
parlor on the ground floor, and very attentively observing
him, the Abbe, after half an hour's conversation
with M. St. Gille, heard himself called, on a sudden,
by his name and title, in a voice that seemed to come
from the roof of a house at a distance; and whilst he
was pointing to the house from which the voice had
appeared to him to proceed, he was yet more surprised
at hearing the words, "it was not from that quarter,"
apparently in the same kind of voice as before, but
which now seemed to issue from under the earth at
one of the corners of the room. In short, this fictitious
voice played, as it were, everywhere about him,
and seemed to proceed from any quarter or distance
from which the operator chose to transmit it to him.
To the Abbe, though conscious that the voice proceeded
from the mouth of M. St. Gille, he appeared absolutely
mute while he was exercising his talent; nor
could any change in his countenance be discovered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
But he observed that M. St. Gille presented only the
profile of his face to him while he was speaking as a
ventriloquist.</p>

<p>On another occasion, M. St. Gille sought for shelter
from a storm in a neighboring convent; and finding
the community in mourning, and inquiring the cause,
he was told that one of their body, much esteemed by
them, had lately died. Some of their religious brethren
attended him to the church, and showing him the tomb
of their deceased brother, spoke very feelingly of the
scanty honors that had been bestowed on his memory,
when suddenly a voice was heard, apparently proceeding
from the roof of the choir, lamenting the situation
of the defunct in purgatory, and reproaching the
brotherhood with their want of zeal on his account.
The whole community being afterwards convened in
the church, the voice from the roof renewed its lamentations
and reproaches, and the whole convent fell
on their faces, and vowed a solemn reparation. Accordingly,
they first chanted a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">De profundis</i> in full
choir; during the intervals of which the ghost occasionally
expressed the comfort he received from their
pious exercises and ejaculations in his behalf. The
prior, when this religious service was concluded, entered
into a serious conversation with M. St. Gille,
and inveighed against the incredulity of our modern
sceptics and pretended philosophers on the article of
ghosts and apparitions; and St. Gille found it difficult
to convince the fathers that the whole was a deception.</p>

<p>M. Alexandre, the noted ventriloquist, had an extraordinary
facility in counterfeiting the faces of other
people. At Abbotsford, during a visit there, he actually
sat to a sculptor five times in the character of a
noted clergyman, with whose real features the sculptor
was well acquainted. When the sittings were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
closed and the bust modelled, the mimic cast off his
wig and assumed dress, and appeared with his own
natural countenance, to the terror almost of the sculptor,
and to the great amusement of Sir Walter Scott
and others who had been in the secret.</p>

<p>Of this most celebrated ventriloquist it is related
that on one occasion he was passing along the Strand,
when a friend desired a specimen of his abilities. At
this instant a load of hay was passing along near Temple
Bar, when Alexandre called attention to the suffocating
cries of a man in the centre of the hay. A
crowd gathered round and stopped the astonished
carter, and demanded why he was carrying a fellow-creature
in his hay. The complaints and cries of the
smothered man now became painful, and there was
every reason to believe that he was dying. The
crowd, regardless of the stoppage to the traffic, instantly
proceeded to unload the hay into the street.
The smothered voice urged them to make haste; but
the feelings of the people may be imagined when the
cart was empty and nobody was found, while Alexandre
and his friend walked off laughing at the unexpected
results of their trick.</p>

<p>The individual who wishes to know anything about
this wonderful art must learn to distinguish distances,
and be able, by giving the proper pitch to the voice, to
make it reach exactly to the point indicated. He
must also know that the attention of the audience
should be directed either by the eyes or a gesture of the
hand to the spot whence the voice is supposed to issue.
In order to cover the features of any modern ventriloquial
entertainment, I will here give the rules for the
two voices required, with an example of the dialogue
in each case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span></p>

<h3>VOICE I.</h3>

<p>The first is the voice in which Frederic Maccabe
excelled. To acquire this voice, speak one word or
sentence in your own natural tones; then open the
mouth and fix the jaws fast, as though you were trying
to hinder anyone from opening them farther, or shutting
them; draw the tongue back in a ball; speak the
same words, and the sound, instead of being formed in
the mouth will be formed in the pharynx. Great attention
must be paid to holding the jaws rigid. The
sound will then be found to imitate a voice heard from
the other side of a door when it is closed, or under a
floor, or through a wall. To ventriloquize with this
voice, let the operator stand with his back to the audience
against a door. Give a gentle tap at the door,
and call aloud in a natural voice, inquiring, "Who is
there?" This will have the effect of drawing the attention
of the audience to the person supposed to be
outside. Then fix the jaw as described, and utter in
voice No. 1 (explained above) any words you please,
such as, "I want to come in." Ask questions in the
natural voice and answer in the other. When you
have done this, open the door a little, and hold a conversation
with the imaginary person. As the door is
now open, it is obvious that the voice must be altered,
for a voice will not sound to the ear when a door is
open the same as when closed. Therefore, the voice
must be made to appear face to face, or close to the
ventriloquist. To do this the voice must be altered
from the original note or pitch, but be made in another
part of the mouth. This is done by closing the
lips tight and drawing one corner of the mouth downwards,
or towards the ear. Then let the lips open at
that corner only, the other part to remain closed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
Next breathe, as it were, the words out of the orifice
formed. Do not speak distinctly, but expel the
breath in short pulls at each word, and as loud as possible.
By so doing you will cause the illusion in the
mind of the listeners, that they hear the same voice
which they heard when the door was closed, but which
is now heard more distinctly and nearer, on account of
the door being open. This voice must always be used
when the ventriloquist wishes it to appear that the
sound comes from some one close at hand, but through
an obstacle. The description of voice and dialogue
may be varied, as in the following <span class="locked">example:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>THE SUFFOCATED VICTIM.</h3>

<p>A large box or close cupboard is used indiscriminately,
as it may be handy. The student will rap or
kick the box apparently by accident. The voice will
then utter a hoarse and subdued groan, apparently
from the box or closet.</p>

<p>Student (pointing to the box with an air of astonishment):
What is that?</p>

<p>Voice: I won't do so any more. I am nearly dead.</p>

<p>Student: Who are you? How came you there?</p>

<p>Voice: I only wanted to see what was going on.
Let me out, do.</p>

<p>Student: But I don't know who you are.</p>

<p>Voice: Oh yes, you do.</p>

<p>Student: Who are you?</p>

<p>Voice: Your old schoolfellow, Tom &mdash;&mdash;. You
know me.</p>

<p>Student: Why, he's in Canada.</p>

<p>Voice (sharply): No he ain't, he's here; but be
quick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
Student (opening the lid): Perhaps he's come by
the underground railroad? Hallo!</p>

<p>Voice (not so muffled, as described in directions):
Now then, give us a hand.</p>

<p>Student (closing the lid or door sharply): No, I
won't.</p>

<p>Voice (as before): Have pity (Tom, or Jack, or
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. as the case may be), or I shall be choked.</p>

<p>Student: I don't believe you are what you say.</p>

<p>Voice: Why don't you let me out and see before I
am dead?</p>

<p>Student (opening and shutting the lid and varying
the voice accordingly): Dead! not you. When did
you leave Canada?</p>

<p>Voice: Last week. Oh! I am choking.</p>

<p>Student: Shall I let him out? (opening the door.)
There's no one here.</p>

<h3>VOICE II.</h3>

<p>The second voice is the more easy to be acquired.
It is the voice by which all ventriloquists make a supposed
person speak from a long distance, or from, or
through the ceiling. In the first place, with your back
to the audience, direct their attention to the ceiling by
pointing to it or by looking intently at it. Call loudly,
and ask some question, as though you believed some
person to be concealed there. Make your own voice
very distinct, and as near the lips as possible, inasmuch
as that will help the illusion. Then in exactly
the same tone and pitch answer; but, in order that the
same voice may seem to proceed from the point indicated,
the words must be formed at the back part of
the roof of the mouth. To do this the lower jaw
must be drawn back and held there, the mouth open,
which will cause the palate to be elevated and drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
nearer to the pharynx, and the sound will be reflected
in that cavity, and appear to come from the roof. Too
much attention cannot be paid to the manner in which
the breath is used in this voice. When speaking to
the supposed person, expel the words with a deep,
quick breath.</p>

<p>When answering in the imitative manner, the breath
must be held back and expelled very slowly, and the
voice will come in a subdued and muffled manner, little
above a whisper, but so as to be well distinguished.
To cause the supposed voice to come nearer by degrees,
call loudly, and say, "I want you down here,"
or words to that effect. At the same time make a motion
downwards with your hand. Hold some conversation
with the voice and cause it to say, "I am
coming," or "Here I am," each time indicating the
descent with the hand. When the voice is supposed
to approach nearer, the sound must alter, to denote
the progress of the movement. Therefore let the
voice at every supposed step, roll, as it were, by degrees,
from the pharynx more into the cavity of the
mouth, and at each supposed step, contracting the
opening of the mouth, until the lips are drawn up as if
you were whistling. By so doing the cavity of the
mouth will be very much enlarged. This will cause
the voice to be obscured, and so appear to come nearer
by degrees. At the same time, care must be taken
not to articulate the consonant sounds plainly, as that
would cause the disarrangement of the lips and cavity
of the mouth; and in all imitative voices the consonants
must scarcely be articulated at all, especially if
the ventriloquist faces the audience. For example:
suppose the imitative voice is made to say, "Mind
what you are doing, you bad boy," it must be spoken,
as if it were written, "'ind 'ot you're doing, you 'ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
whoy." This kind of articulation may be practised
by forming the words in the pharynx, and then sending
them out of the mouth by sudden expulsions of the
breath clean from the lungs at every word. This is
most useful in ventriloquism, and to illustrate it we
will take the man on the roof as an illustration. This
is an example almost invariably successful, and is constantly
used by skilled professors of the art. As we
have before repeatedly intimated, the eyes and attention
of the audience must be directed to the supposed
spot from whence the illusive voice is supposed to <span class="locked">proceed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Student: Are you up there, Jem?</p>

<p>Voice: Hallo! who's that?</p>

<p>Student: It's I! Are you nearly finished?</p>

<p>Voice: Only three more slates to put on, master.</p>

<p>Student: I want you here, Jem.</p>

<p>Voice: I am coming directly.</p>

<p>Student: Which way, Jem?</p>

<p>Voice: Over the roof and down the trap. (Voice is
supposed to be moving, as the student turns and points
with his finger.)</p>

<p>Student: Which way?</p>

<p>Voice (nearer): Through the trap and down the
stairs.</p>

<p>Student: How long shall you be?</p>

<p>Voice: Only a few minutes. I am coming as fast as
I can.</p>

<p>The voice now approaches the door, and is taken up
by the same tone, but produced as in the first voice.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I have room to add only a few polyphonic imitations.
To imitate the tormenting bee, the student
must use considerable pressure on his chest, as if he
was about to groan suddenly, but instead of which, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
sound must be confined and prolonged in the throat:
the greater the pressure, the higher will be the faint
note produced, and which will perfectly resemble the
buzzing of the bee or wasp. Now, to imitate the
buzzing of a bluebottle fly, it will be necessary for the
sound to be made with the lips instead of the throat;
this is done by closing the lips very tight, except at
one corner, where a small aperture is left; fill that
cheek full of wind, but not the other, then slowly
blow or force the wind contained in the cheek out of
the aperture: if this is done properly, it will cause a
sound exactly like the buzzing of a bluebottle fly.</p>

<p>The noise caused by planing and sawing wood can
also be imitated without much difficulty, and it causes
a great deal of amusement. The student must, however,
bear in mind that every action must be <i>imitated</i>
as well as the noise, for the eye assists to delude the
ear. We have even seen ventriloquists carry this eye
deception so far as to have a few shavings to scatter
as they proceed, and a piece of wood to fall when the
sawing is ended. To imitate planing, the student
must stand at a table a little distance from the audience,
and appear to take hold of a plane and push it
forward: the sound as of a plane is made as though
you were dwelling on the last part of the word hu<i>sh</i>&mdash;dwell
upon the <i>sh</i> a little, as <i>tsh</i>, and then clip it short
by causing the tongue to close with the palate, then
over again. Letters will not convey the peculiar sound
of sawing&mdash;it must be studied from nature.</p>

<span class="subhead">"ON THE ROAD."</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Theatrical life is full enough of business and bustle,
even when a company is playing a long engagement in
a large city; but when "on the road," travelling from
town to town&mdash;playing here a week and there a week,
with one-night stands in the intervening "villages,"
actors and managers find it no easy task to retain their
health and spirits, and keep up with their "dates;"
and with all but a few organizations located almost
permanently in New York, thus flitting from place to
place&mdash;a round of anxiety and railroad experiences
that lasts through forty weeks of each year&mdash;makes
up the easy, glorious, and blissful existence that so
many people outside of the profession imagine is the
unalloyed portion of those who are in it.</p>

<p>As much of the business of a company's season as
can be arranged in New York during the summer, is
attended to by the manager. He meets the prominent
theatrical managers of the country on "The Square"
and makes dates at their respective houses for his attraction.
Having located his route as to the large cities
he proceeds to fill in the intervals with one or two-night
stands in smaller places, and this being done he
and his company are ready to take the road just as
soon as the season begins. The contracts for cities
like Chicago, Cincinnati, Louisville, New Orleans, and
St. Louis are made and signed in New York during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
the summer vacation. The others are completed while
the company is on the road.</p>

<p>Ahead of every attraction is a press agent, herald,
avant-courier, or, as he began to call himself two
years ago, a business manager. When he invades a
town the first place he makes a rush for is the most
available opera house or hall, with the proprietor of
which he makes a contract like the <span class="locked">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

<span class="smcap">Belleville, Ill.</span>........ 1882.
</p>

<p>This is to certify that I have rented the hall (room
or theatre) known as ................ to the Madison
Square Theatre Company for .......... night ....,
viz ....................... for the sum of .........
dollars per night, which includes license, stage hands,
ushers, ticket-seller, etc. Said hall, passage-way, and
stage to be well lighted, and also to be kept clean and
well warmed, with services of janitor and privilege of
matinee included.</p>

<p class="in0">
<i>Signed</i>:</p>

<p class="sigright">.................. Lessee.</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>:</p>

<p class="sigright">................ Business Manager.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Numerous other contracts are made,&mdash;for hauling
baggage, for carriages and omnibus, for orchestra,
etc. The hotel contract, which is as follows, is very
<span class="locked">explicit:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This is to certify that the landlord of .....................
does hereby agree with the Agent of the
Madison Square Theatre Company to board and lodge
the said company, consisting of ........ persons, more
or less, for .......... days, more or less, at the rate
of ........... cents per day for each person. Three
meals and one (night's) lodging to constitute a day's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
board, and for any time less than one day the charge
shall be at the same rate per diem as is above mentioned.
Fires to be furnished at .............. cents
per each room. No charge to be made under the
above agreement providing the party see fit to go elsewhere.
Agent to be kept at same rates.</p>

<p class="sigright">
..................... Landlord."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Having got through with making contracts the agent
begins to "bill the town." The amount of billing
that is done depends largely upon the reputation of
the star or attraction, and the manner in which the
newspapers have been worked. An actress like Mary
Anderson puts out but about one hundred three-sheet
bills&mdash;a three-sheet bill being the ordinary poster
that is seen upon a single bill-board&mdash;in any of the
large cities. Sarah Bernhardt and Adelina Patti, who
were kept before the public by the press for many
months before they came to this country, needed but
a few three-sheet bills and a simple announcement of
their coming in the newspapers. Mrs. Langtry,
Christine Nilsson, and Henry Irving will be billed in
the same economical way when they reach our shores.
Edwin Booth and John McCullough, like Mary Anderson,
use only a small quantity of three-sheet bills for
advertising on the walls. These people require few
lithographs, and are likewise fortunate in not being required
to buy large space in the papers. Nearly all
the minor melodramatic and comedy attractions take
to the circus style of advertising. Charles L. Davis, of
"Alvin Joslyn" fame, who wears the largest diamond
and carries the finest watch in the profession, boasts
that he always likes to bill against a circus. When he
was in St. Louis during the season of 1881&ndash;2, Mr.
W.&nbsp;R. Cottrell, the city bill-poster, told me that Davis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
put out about four thousand sheets, and everlastingly
sprinkled the windows with colored lithographs. Mr.
Cottrell also told me that this does not approach the
lavishness of circuses in decorating the fences and
walls and bill-boards of cities. These latter usually
put out not less than ten thousand sheets, and the
Great London Show a few seasons ago would spread
from eighteen to twenty thousand sheets before the
eyes of a city having a population of four hundred
thousand. The bill-poster gets three cents per sheet for
posting, and $1 per hundred for distributing lithographs,
so that, as will be understood, a circus or a
theatrical attraction like Charles L. Davis is a bonanza
to the bill-poster.</p>

<p>From the big type of the bill-boards the advance
agent naturally turns his attention to the smaller, but
probably more effective, type of the newspaper. He
rushes into the editorial rooms like a whirlwind, if he
is a cyclonic agent, asks in a voice of thunder for the
dramatic critic, and when that gentleman is pointed
out, after depositing a gilt-edged card and bestrewing
the journalist's desk with a mass of notices from the
Oakland <i>Bugle</i>, the Bragtown <i>Boomerang</i>, and forty
other equally important and severely critical journals,
proceeds to talk so loudly that he disturbs all the
writers in the room, and has the managing editor on
the point nineteen times out of twenty of ordering him
out of the office.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, my boy," he shouts, "we just
laid 'em out cold in Pilot Knob last night. Just got a
telegram from the manager. See here: 'House
jammed to the doors; hundreds turned away; great
enthusiasm; big sales to-morrow night.' Now that's no
gag, but the dead square, bang-up truth, s'elp me
God."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
"I see the Horse-Tail Bar <i>Sentinel</i> gives you folks
fits," the dramatic critic quietly suggests. "It says
your play is bad and your company worse&mdash;how is
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh that fellow is a bloody duffer," the agent replies
at the top of his voice. "Tell you the truth, we
had a little trouble with him about comps. He wanted
a bushel of 'em, and because we wouldn't give 'em up
blasted us. But we did a rattling good business all
the same, and don't you forget it?"</p>

<p>And in this way the cyclonic agent rattles along,
tormenting everybody within hearing distance until he
gets ready to go; and when he is gone there is a sigh
of relief all around the office. The managing editor
comes out and asks the dramatic <span class="locked">critic:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Who was that d&mdash;d fool?"</p>

<p>"The agent of the Doorstep Comic Opera Company,"
the dramatic critic replies.</p>

<p>"Well, the next time he comes in here just tell him
this is not a deaf and dumb asylum. We don't want
any serenades from side-show blowers. Don't give
his d&mdash;d old company more than two lines, and make
it less than that if you can."</p>

<p>Fortunately for the profession this style of advance
agent is dying out, and men who understand newspapers
better are coming in. There are many real
gentlemen, clever, quiet and effective, in the business,
like Mr. E.&nbsp;D. Price, formerly of the Detroit <i>Post
and Tribune</i>; Frank Farrell, who graduated from the
New Orleans <i>Times</i> office, and others who have forsaken
journalism for the equally arduous, but more
lucrative positions that enterprising and long-headed
theatrical managers offer them.</p>

<p>The advance agent sees that the hall or theatre is in
proper condition, looks after the sale of reserved seats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
distributes his "comps" as judiciously as circumstances
will allow, and confronts everywhere he goes
the cunning and omnipresent dead-head&mdash;that abomination
of the show business who will spend $5 with an
agent to get a free ticket from him, when admission
and a reserved sent may be purchased for $1. If the
dead-head fails to circumvent the agent he quietly
awaits the coming of the company, when he lies in ambush
for the manager, of whom he demands a pass or
his life. In fact, the manager often has to undo a
great deal that his agent has done in a town, and to do
over again much that the avant-courier had seemingly
done in a satisfactory manner. The company, too,
frequently find the way not so smooth or pleasant as
the agent has represented it to be: the hall or theatre
in which the performance is to be given is often a
dingy, dismal place that is not only without conveniences
of any kind, but what is worse, may not be
proof against anything like demonstrative weather;
the hotel fare is bad, and the accommodations no better;
the mayor, the town council, and sometimes the
prominent citizens, must have free passes; the local
papers want hatfuls of complimentary tickets, and
with a house half filled with dead-heads and one-third
of the benches empty, they must, in the face of most
discouraging circumstances, appear as entertainers or
meet with the severest denunciations of the pigmy
press and the most galling criticism from the ungrateful
army of dead-heads.</p>

<p>Now and then an actor or an actress contracts a cold
during a barn-storming tour, and the nomadic life not
being calculated to aid the healing power of medicines,
the seeds of death are sown, and soon the played-out
player sinks from sight, and without causing a single
ripple upon the surface of the great sea of life, goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
down to the grave. The agent and the manager, too,
share this danger, and altogether the life of professional
people when "on the road" is not so bright or
joyful as to cause any one acquainted with their trials
and troubles to envy them their lot.</p>

<p>To the outside world the player's life seems always
bright&mdash;a rose-carpeted path with sunshine forever
straying about the feet and breath of the sweetest
gardens always in their atmosphere. To the players
themselves, notwithstanding the hard work, it has the
same beauty and fascinations that other professions
have for those who have entered them. Lotta receiving
the wild plaudits of her newsboy admirers&mdash;for
all over the country the street Arabs express their
willingness to "do ennythin' in de world fur Lottie"&mdash;accepting
the baskets of flowers they send her with the
pennies they have pooled, and doing her utmost to respond
to a score of encores in response to their appeals
is as charming a little picture of perfect happiness and
contentment as we could find anywhere. Judic, the
great opera bouffe singer, peddling cherries, at the
great charity fair in Paris, from two panniers borne by
a jackass, crying, "Buy my cherries, monsieur. I
don't sell them dear. Five francs, the little basket,"
is a noble example of the generosity that distinguishes
the profession of which she is a member. A popular
American actress selling photographs for a little cripple
she met in the street, and who had been rebuffed
at several, is another example of the leaning towards
charity and the kind-heartedness of a class of people
against whom many bigots raise their hands and to
whom they turn their backs, saying, as the Rev. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
Sabini said, that he didn't want to have anything to do
with actors. The reader has probably heard the story,
but I will repeat it here: George Holland, the actor, died
in his eightieth year, on December 20, 1870. He was a
player of exceeding merit in his day, and his demise
was widely and deeply regretted. Friends gathered
around his casket in the awful moment when they were
to part with him forever. The rites of the church were
wanted for him, of course, and an actor friend went to
Rev. Sabini and asked him to officiate. He declined,
saying: "I want to have nothing to do with an actor.
There is a little place around the corner were they do
these things." And sure enough there was, and the
actors took their dead friend into "the little place
around the corner," and Dr. Houghton said the last
prayer over the dead player. That "place" is now
known among actors and by the public too as "the
little church around the corner." It is the Church of
the Transfiguration, and is on Twenty-ninth Street
near Madison Avenue.</p>

<p>It is only occasionally that scandal is given by the
theatrical profession, but these few and far-between
occasions are sufficient to keep alive the bad opinion
that certain people have of actors and actresses. It
is true the class is weak at many points, as are other
classes, but as I have urged before, they maintain
a higher standard of morality and adorn their circle
better than any other people whose paths are strewn as
plentifully with temptations. At the beginning of the
eighteenth century the stage was in very bad condition
because society was in a worse condition, and if
there is frailty in the ranks of actresses of to-day, and
weaknesses among actors, it is because their surroundings
compel them to be what they are, and even
under this compulsion they can hold their heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
as high as their neighbors and look them in the
face without feeling that they are any worse than the
rest of the world, even if they are so bad. It is my
purpose to say something about the dark side of theatrical
life that the reader may see just what there is
in the talk indulged by the scandal-mongers of the
anti-theatrical class, and that it may be known that
their indiscretions and their sins are no more heinous
than the sins and transgressions of other people, and
that in very few instances are they the outcome of the
actor or actress's professional surroundings.</p>

<p>The estrangement of Edwin Booth and his wife or
the divorce of Edwin Forrest from his wife did not
cause the world to think any the less of these gentlemen
as actors, and the events did not bring any opprobrium
upon the profession. Sarah Bernhardt's
open avowal that her children were fatherless and they
were only "accidents" was a frank confession of an
early indiscretion that almost everybody was ready to
forgive. She was not received by society in this country,
but society knelt before her at the shrine of
Thespis, as they did at the feet of Mme. Patti, who
flaunted Nicolini in the face of the public, as the successor
of the Marquis de Caux in all the rights of a
husband although there never had been any marriage
ceremony to make the tenor the legal companion of
the beautiful diva. For the sake of their art the sins
of these two gifted women were partially forgotten,
and while society could not open its doors to Mlle.
Bernhardt or Mme. Patti, it went readily to the open
doors through which the presence of the actress and of
the songstress was to be reached.</p>

<p>A New York correspondent says: "Having mentioned
two French actresses, let me drop into the true
story of Bernhardt and Colombier's quarrel, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
book about America which has been put forth in Colombier's
name. When Bernhardt came over here, she
was accompanied by Jehan Soudan, a Parisian writer.
He was very small, closely buttoned up to the neck,
very bushy haired, and very much like a particularly
mild and girlish divinity student. For all that, he was
the accredited temporary lover of Bernhardt. His
other errand was to write an account of her tour, to
be published as from her own pen. While in this city
he was an object of considerable ridicule, and his name
was maltreated from Jehan Soudan into Sudden
Johnny. But Colombier, the fair and fat actress of
Bernhardt's company, did not regard him as comic.
Quite on the contrary, she fell in love with him, and
he fell in love with her. However, this new reciprocity
of hearts was kept hidden until near the end of
the journey. Then it came out through Sudden
Johnny carelessly kissing Colombier too loud in a thin-partitioned
dressing-room. The smack was heard by
Bernhardt. I don't imagine that she cared much for
Johnny, or would have missed him from the ranks of
her favored admirers; but it made her just as mad
as she could be to lose him to Colombier. Now,
Colombier's beauty was marred by a deflection of her
nose to one side. That's not much, for the chances
are ten to one that the sides of your own face don't
exactly agree. Try a glass critically, and see. Well,
when Colombier emerged from her room with Johnny,
to go on the stage, Sarah regarded her quizzically, and
then said something in French equivalent <span class="locked">to:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"'Ah, my dear, I fear you kiss too much on one side
of your mouth. It has really and truly bent your nose
awry. Do let the other side have some of Jehan's
attention.'</p>

<p>"No more was said. But that Johnny and Colombier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
plotted a deep revenge is evident, for the book
appears in Paris with the name of Colombier instead
of Bernhardt as author, and among its numerous
ridiculous lies about Americans are some spiteful little
flings at Sarah. Thus Sudden Johnny gets even."</p>

<p>Mme. Patti, too, had a young man with her&mdash;Michael
Mortier, brother of the editor of the Paris <i>Figaro</i>&mdash;who
was to write a book for her, but in St. Louis he
spoke too freely to a newspaper reporter about Mme.
Patti's relations to Nicolini, and Mortier's life was thereafter
made so miserable that he was glad soon to make
a bee line for Paris, where it is to be hoped he is at
present.</p>

<p>A London correspondent tells us how a favorite
actress of that place faced three husbands, and as it is
in order to continue turning the crank of the scandal
machine while foreign talent is the material to be
ground, I will give the paragraph. He says: "The
true glory of the Lyceum Theatre is that English Bernhardt,
Miss Ellen Terry. This blue-eyed, blonde-locked,
Saxon siren is not a radiant beauty as was the
ill-fated Adelaide Neilson, but she is something better&mdash;she
is a charmeuse, as the French call any one possessing
that peculiar feminine&mdash;which she exercises so
powerfully&mdash;magnetism. She is the most gifted,
and withal the most naturally graceful, woman that I
have ever seen. The little movements and artistic
attitudes of Sarah Bernhardt would seem forced and
artificial beside that unborn charm and harmony of
gesture, unstudied and perfect as the ripple of tall
grasses or the swaying of the branches of a weeping
willow beneath a summer breeze. She is pure
womanly, every inch of her. She cannot be awkward
even when she tries; and I saw her try the other night
in 'The Belle's Stratagem;' but instead of transforming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
<i>Letitia Handy</i> into a country hoyden in accordance
with the text, she only succeeded in assuming a pretty
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">espieglerie</i> that, had I been <i>Doricourt</i>, would have
driven me to catch her straightway in my arms and
kiss her, declaring that she was charming anyhow. Off
the stage I am told that she is quite as fascinating as
when before the foot-lights. She has proved the extent
of her power of enchantment by successfully winning
and wedding three husbands, all of whom are still
living, divorce and not death having released her from
two of them. In fact, it is reported that while walking
in the Grosvenor Gallery recently, with her present
spouse, Mr. Kelly, she came face to face with her two
former husbands, who were promenading there together,
and that the only embarrassed personage of
the quartette was Mr. Kelly; and they do say that the
law will soon be called into requisition to break the
bonds that unite her to her present spouse, and that
she will then become the wife of a prominent English
actor. Truly this wonderful and interesting lady
ought to inscribe on her wedding-ring the motto said
to have been adopted by the old Countess of Desmond
on the occasion of her fourth <span class="locked">marriage:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Jealousy is at the bottom of nearly every scandal
connected with the stage, or with people who have
been on the stage. The story of Lizzie McCall's
crime is a peculiarly sad one. She had been a favorite
burlesque actress, and was playing young heroines with
Boucicault in 1880 when she met and married George
Barry Wall, a young man of twenty-five years, she
being twenty-three. She promised him to leave the
stage forever, and in order that she might not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
placed in the way of temptation Wall made his home
in New Utrecht, Long Island, removing thence to New
York. Jealousy early made its appearance in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
home, and their married life was not happy or peaceful.
They lived together for eighteen months, however, until
one fine morning after a violent quarrel she snatched
up a pistol and shot her husband through the throat.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE M'CALL TRAGEDY.</div></div>

<p>A Russian theatre not long since was the scene of a
real drama which deserves a place among the serious
accidents of the stage. The two leading actresses
were Frenchwomen who had come to St. Petersburg
together as friends. They had occupied the same
house, and lived on terms of the warmest intimacy
for some time. Then a young swell, who had enrolled
himself among the admirers of one of them, began to
pay court to the other. The consequence was a jealousy
which finally led to a separation of the whilom
friends. They remained members of the same company,
however, and their jealousies found vent about
the theatre. One night after a dinner washed down
with much champagne, the jilted actress became very
violent, and attempted to assault her rival in her
dressing-room. She was prevented, and went off
threatening vengeance. The course of the piece
brought them together in an impassioned scene, in
the conclusion of which the one had to warn the other
off with a dagger. Heated with wine, her jealousy
inflamed by the presence of her faithless lover in a
stage box, the jilted artiste lost control of herself, and
instead of a warning, dealt her rival a stab. The
wounded woman fell bleeding to the stage. Fortunately
she was not fatally hurt, and her assailant
escaped with an authoritative order to leave Russia,
and stay away.</p>

<p>Miss Bertha Welby, who is a popular and talented
actress, was a member of the "Only a Farmer's
Daughter" company, of which Miss Lilian Cleves
was the star. The two ladies could not get along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
together. Miss Welby insisted that Miss Cleves was
jealous of her rival's success; and so it went on,
until at last a low ruffian visited Miss Welby in her
dressing-room one night, after the performance, and
demanded money from her for having applauded her
in several towns. She was afraid of the fellow, she
said, and so paid him the sum he asked&mdash;$15. She
then told him to go, and he went; but Miss Cleves, it
appears, had assembled the members of the company
at the door of the dressing-room to witness the payment
of the man, who, as she declared, had led the
claque that was making Miss Welby a greater actress
than the star. Miss Welby asserted that the whole
thing was a piece of blackmail, and that Miss Cleves
had instigated it.</p>

<p>Operatic stars are violent sometimes in these exhibitions
of jealousy. It will be remembered that at the
last Cincinnati music festival, Gerster absolutely refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
to sing if Miss Cary preceded her, and the Hungarian
prima donna was induced to appear only by the
graceful withdrawal of the fair American songstress.
Miss Kellogg and Mlle. Roze had a bitter war in St.
Louis in 1879, on account of their dressing-rooms, the
American prima donna insisting on having the best the
Grand Opera House afforded. She got it at last, and
was shocked when she heard a story to the effect that
Wakefield, then one of the proprietors, had a peep-hole
above the dressing-room which he not only made use of
himself but invited his friends to use.</p>

<p>The jealousy of Mrs. McKee Rankin (Kitty Blanchard)
has more than once been made the subject of newspaper
articles. She thought her robust husband went
through the love scene with the <i>Widow</i> (Miss Eva
Randolph) in the play with too lavish a display of
affection, and the green-eyed monster took possession
of her. She stood in the wings every night and
watched the scene, and the more she watched it the
madder she got until at last she demanded from her
husband that Miss Randolph be dismissed. This Mr.
Rankin sternly refused to do. Then Mrs. Rankin refused
to play, and a clever young lady was given the part
of <i>Billy Piper</i>. The newspapers praised the new <i>Billy</i>
so highly that Mrs. Rankin hurried back to resume the
part, but remained cold toward and entirely estranged
from her husband. After some time the wound was
healed and the couple reunited. There were several
split-ups of this kind, but Mr. and Mrs. Rankin are
now living happily together, and it is to be hoped that
the success of their new play, "49," will keep them
happy forever.</p>

  <div class="caption">JEALOUSY.</div></div>

<p>Now and then the jealous actress's feelings are expressed
in a rather ridiculous manner. During the run
of a spectacular play in one of the large cities one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
those old chaps who like to linger behind the scenes
and tickle the fairies under the chin succeeded in making
himself the admirer of one of the ladies&mdash;one who
played a prince or something of that kind. He
brought her flowers every night, took her to supper
after the play, and often paid for a ride under the
starry night at a time when he should have been resting
his hoary head upon his pillow at home. He kept
this up for a while; then he suddenly turned his attention
to another girl, who was doing a skipping-rope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
dance during an interval in the play. He began to
bring her flowers and to feed her on midnight oysters,
and to take her on moonlight rides. The pretty prince
stood it as long as she could; then she made up her
mind to be revenged on the old deceiver. She waited
one night until she saw him talking to the skipping-rope
dancer, when she picked up a broom, and stealing
to the opposite side of the scene, made a high hit
at his plug hat, just as he was presenting the rival a
bouquet, and knocked the piece of head-gear clear into
the outfield. The ancient Lothario felt around among
the few hairs on the top of his head to see whether
a piece of skull had not been chipped off; the skipping-rope
dancer laughed; the pretty prince hauled off and
was about to bat the bouquet to second base when the
dancer danced, and what remained to do was to advise
the "old gray" to go, which he did rapidly after regaining
possession of his battered hat. He was advised
that if he returned any more the broom would
be used upon himself instead of his hat; and the scenes
that he had haunted so long knew him no more after
that night.</p>

<p>A New York wife wondered for a long time where
her husband went at night. At least she learned that he
haunted a down-town theatre. She knew her husband
was very fond of the drama, but was astonished when
she found out that he was patronizing the play without
taking her along, so she dressed up one evening and
going up to the box-office, asked the young man whose
smiling face shone through the window, if Mr. So-and-So
was there? Now she had gone to the right source
for her information. Mr. So-and-So had taken away
the affections of one of the actresses from the man in
the box-office; therefore the man in the box-office
manfully replied that Mr. So-and-So was back in Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
Whatdyecaller's dressing-room. Would the man in
the box-office be kind enough to show Mr. So-and-So's
wife where the dressing-room was? He would, most
gladly. Calling his assistant to the window the
treasurer took the lady in through the stage entrance
and pointed out the dressing-room. Sure enough
there was Mr. So-and-So in very close relation and
very close conversation with Miss Whatdyecaller, who
being a ballet girl, in the act of getting herself into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
her gauze and spangles, had little else on than her
tights. The husband was astounded; the wife was
boiling over with rage; the dancer did not know what
to make of it. The husband said that there was blood
in his spouse's eye and fled the scene. Mrs. So-and-So
then turned her attention to the lady in summer
costume, and there was a war of words that ended in
the actress snapping her fingers in the wife's face,
while the latter, unable to do or say anything in her
rage, strutted out after her faithless lord and master,
who was afraid to return home for three days, and did
not return until he saw a "personal" in the <i>Herald</i>
saying that all would be forgiven and no questions
asked.</p>

<p>The meanest trick, I think, that was ever prompted
by jealousy was one in which a well-known comedian
and a handsome juvenile lady were made the victims.
Having determined to go to a fancy dress ball, they
borrowed a Mephistopheles and Venus costume, and
having dressed at the theatre in which they were playing,
took their clothes to their boarding-house, the
comedian retaining only his ulster and the young lady
only her silk fur-lined cloak. In the same house the
leading lady roomed, and as the comedian had been
somewhat attentive to her she grew jealous when she
saw him escorting the other flame to the ball, and that
both might be taught a lesson she resolved upon a plan
of action which she faithfully carried out. The
comedian and his companion had plenty of fun at the
ball. They returned to their boarding-house about three
A.&nbsp;M. Both had latch-keys, but they wouldn't work.
Somebody had fastened down the bolt. What were
they to do? It was a cold morning with snow on the
ground and snow still falling. Their carriage had
gone; they didn't wish to go to a hotel in masquerade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
style, so they resolved to stick it out until the door
would be opened. And they did so. The comedian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
wrapped his ulster around him and sat down on the
doorstep; the young lady gathered her cloak around
her as tightly as she could and stood up in a corner of
the entrance, shivering and wondering what the people
thought who passed by and looked at them. They remained
there three hours, and when the door was
opened, it was the leading lady who did the opening.
She laughed as if she would lose her life in the effort
when she saw the plight the two were in, and said as
they passed up the hall that she was sorry she had put
down that bolt when she came home, but she thought
they were both in the house.</p>

<p>The story of an actor's jealousy is nicely told by a
New York paper in the following: A handsome young
actress attached regularly to one of the New York
theatres has a husband and a baby, a sickly little thing,
and the husband is outrageously jealous, all the more
that this season he has done "job work," which has
kept him "on the road" pretty constantly. Lately
he "came in," the "combination" with which he was
connected having "gone up." He arrived unexpectedly
late one afternoon, and found his wife out. On
the table lay a note addressed to her in a masculine
hand. It was open and ran <span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>: I do not think you have any cause
to be anxious about the baby. It is only cutting its
teeth a little hard&mdash;that's all. However, as you desire
it, and say it would relieve your mind while you
are away at the theatre, I will come to-night about
nine and stay all night with you. Don't speak of the
trouble. I shall only be too glad to let you get a little
sleep after being up so much with baby.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Your true friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">K.&nbsp;S. Stanton</span>, M.&nbsp;D."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The husband was furious at this note, seemingly so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
harmless. He thrust it into his pocket, and without
waiting to see his wife strode from the house. He
had now, he thought, what he had long suspected,
proof of his wife's infidelity. Why, it was shamless!
Dr. Stanton would pass the night, would he, and
blame it on the baby! but he should find that there
was a husband around ready to deal terrible vengeance
upon the betrayer. His feelings were not pleasant
ones, as he lay perdue the rest of the day, nursing his
wrath, to keep it warm. When the pretty young
actress came home she was told that a gentleman had
called and gone away in a great hurry, leaving no
name. At about half-past ten that evening, while she
was at the theatre, the door of her bed-room was
dragged open furiously, and the enraged husband
rushed in. He looked around under the bed and into
the closets, but found no man.</p>

<p>There were, however, two persons in the room.
One an infant slumbering peacefully in the crib, the
other a lady sitting at a small table on which lay several
little bits of white paper into which she was
pouring some globules from a tiny bottle. Her eyes
were blue, her complexion a pure pink and white, and
her hair, curling in loose ringlets over her well-formed
head, was just touched with gray. She looked up astonished
and <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Don't make such a noise; you'll wake the child.
Are you a burglar or what do you want?"</p>

<p>The husband paused in his fruitless search and replied:
"I want that man."</p>

<p>"What man?"</p>

<p>"The man that's made an appointment with my
wife for to-night."</p>

<p>"Who is your wife and what business have you in
Miss &mdash;&mdash;'s bed-room?" asked the lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
"Miss &mdash;&mdash;'s my wife."</p>

<p>"Indeed; well, you can't make me believe that she
ever made any appointment with any man she oughtn't
to make."</p>

<p>"I can't, can't I? read that then," he said, throwing
the letter on the table and scattering the medicine.
The lady read the letter and began to laugh, which enraged
the husband still more.</p>

<p>"Where have you hidden this Dr. Stanton? I will
blow his brains out," he cried.</p>

<p>"No, you won't."</p>

<p>"You see if I don't."</p>

<p>"Well, blow then: I am Dr. Stanton, the author of
that letter," said the lady.</p>

<p>She had to sign her name, Kate S. Stanton, and
show him that the writing was the same as in the note,
before he would be convinced, and then he was the
most sheepish-looking man in New York. The story
got out, and he was the butt of every actor in the
city. They refused to believe that he "walked
home." They condoled with him on account of his
ill health, which forced him to stop acting. They
recommended him to consult a doctor, especially a
lady doctor, Kate Stanton, for example. Altogether
he was so "roasted" that he will have to have more
than a mere letter in future to make him thirst for
vengeance.</p>

<p>"Hang these women doctors!" is all you can get
him to say; "if they must be doctors, why can't
they sign their full name, and not make trouble between
man and wife?"</p>

<span class="subhead">JOHN WILKES BOOTH, PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S ASSASSIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>An interview with an old stager was published a few
months ago in the New York <i>Dramatic News</i>, which
furnishes some new ideas about John Wilkes Booth,
brother of the illustrious Edwin, and the terrible crime
with which he shook a nation to its centre. John
Wilkes Booth, it will be remembered, was the man
who shot and killed President Lincoln, while the latter
was witnessing a performance of "Our American
Cousin," at Ford's Theatre, Washington, D.&nbsp;C., on the
night of April 14, 1865. Laura Keene was on the
stage at the time. Wilkes Booth entered the President's
box and shot him in the back of the head. He
then made his escape by leaping from the box to the
stage, and running thence through the stage entrance
to the street, where he leaped on a horse in waiting for
him. As he sprang from the box, his foot caught in
the American flag which was draped around the railing,
and he fell, spraining his ankle. Landing on the stage,
he jumped up, and waving a dagger over his head,
he shouted, "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sic semper tyrannis</i>." He was subsequently
shot by Sergeant Corbett, while attempting to
escape from a barn in which he had sought refuge.</p>

  <div class="caption">JOHN WILKES BOOTH.</div></div>

<p>Said a veteran actor, referring back a score of
years, to Wilkes Booth's opening at Wallack's old
theatre, on Broadway, near Broome Street: "The
piece to open in was 'Richard III.' Monday morning
came for rehearsal with the star, and the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
had all assembled awaiting him. Many were the
stories told of his wonderful gifts and eccentricities.
One old member of the company, who had played
with him through Georgia, prophesied he would make
a terrific hit. Said he: 'I am an old man at the
business and have seen and played with some of the
greatest tragedians the world has ever seen. I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
played second to Macready. I've divided the applause
with Charles Kean. I've acted often with Forrest,
but in all my long years of professional experience this
young man Wilkes Booth (I might call him a boy),
this boy is the first actor that ever (to use a professional
term) knocked me off my pins, upset and completely
left me without a word to say! Yes, sir, an
old actor like me that you would suppose an earthquake
could not move, was tongue-tied&mdash;unable to
speak his lines.' 'Perhaps you never knew them,'
said our saucy soubrette. The old man smiled, and
then glaring at her said: 'Not know Shakespeare?' He
turned from her with a contemptuous smile. 'Why,
then,' said Jim Collier, 'were you so much at sea if
you were so well up in the lines?' 'Wait till you see
him yourself, then ask. I tell you, gentlemen, there
is more magnetism in Wilkes Booth's eye than in any
human being's I ever saw.' I listened to the old
actor with pleasure, and set him down as an enthusiast&mdash;a
not uncommon thing among some veterans
of the stage, although, as a rule they are apt to carp at
the present and deplore the downfall of the past.
'What do you think?' said Ed. Tilton to me. 'You
know the young man's brother, Edwin, and played
with the father of the boys. So have I; but don't
you think our friend exaggerates a bit?' 'No, I do
not,' said I, 'for I know the genius that runs in the
blood of the Booth family, and have seen it crop up
at times in just such a manner as he describes. The
last engagement that the great Junius Brutus Booth
played in San Francisco only a few weeks before his
death, I was cast for <i>Parson Welldo</i> in a "New Way
to Pay Old Debts." And when <i>Sir Giles</i>, hemmed in
on all sides, is unable to break the combination against
him, sees the parson approaching, the lion immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
becomes a lamb. His look of heavenly sweetness
when I told him of the marriage of his daughter
was a study; but when he learned she was wedded to
his bitterest enemy, only a Dore's pencil could depict
the diabolical malignity of the man. The marks of his
fingers I carried upon my throat for days after, and
when he shrieked in my ear with his hot breath, and
the foam dropping from his lip&mdash;"tell me, devil, are
they married?" I had but to reply "they are," but
was unable to do so. So you see I am prepared for
anything this wonderful young man may turn out
to be.'</p>

<p>"At that moment a commotion was heard at the
back of the stage, and Baker's voice was heard to say:
'Oh! not waiting long; you are on time!' And
striding down the centre of the stage came the young
man himself who was destined to play such an unfortunate
part in the history of our country afterwards.
The stage being dark at his entrance, the foot and
border lights were suddenly turned up and revealed a
face and form not easily described or forgotten. You
have seen a high-mettled racer with his sleek skin and
eye of unusual brilliancy chafing under a restless impatience
to be doing something. It is the only living
thing I could liken him to. After the usual introductions
were over, with a sharp, jerky manner he commenced
the rehearsal. I watched him closely and perceived
the encomiums passed upon him by the old actor
were not in the least exaggerated. Reading entirely
new to us, he gave; business never thought of by the
oldest stager, he introduced; and, when the rehearsal
was over, one and all admitted a great actor was
amongst us. Knowing his own powers, he was very
particular in telling those around him not to be affrighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
at night, as he might (he said, with a smile)
throw a little more fire into the part than at rehearsal.
<i>Lady Anne</i> (Miss Gray) was gently admonished;
<i>Richmond</i>, who was Jim Collier, was bluntly told to
look out in the combat scene. Jim, who was (and probably
is now) something of an athlete, smiled a sickly
smile at the idea of anybody getting the best of him in
a combat scene, and in a sotto voice said to Jim Ward,
'Keep your eye on me to-night.'</p>

<p>"The evening arrived, the house was fair only, and
his reception was not as warm as his merits deserved.
The soliloquy over, then came the scenes with <i>King
Henry</i>, and breaking loose from all the old orthodox,
tie-wig business of the Richards since the days of
Garrick down to Joannes, he gave such a rendition of
the crook-back tyrant as was never seen before, and
perhaps never will be again. Whether it was in the
gentle wooing of the <i>Lady Anne</i>, the hypocrisy of the
king, or the malignant joy at <i>Buckingham's</i> capture
down to the fight and death of the tyrant, originality
was stamped all over and through the performance.
It was a terrible picture, but it had a humorous side
one night. At the commencement of the combat,
when <i>Richard</i>, covered with blood and the dust of the
battle-field, crosses swords with <i>Richmond</i>, Collier
looked defiant and almost seemed to say: 'Now, Mr.
Wilkes Booth, you have been frightening everybody
to-night, try it on me?' And at the lines where
<i>Richard</i> says, 'A dreadful lay; here's to decide it,'
the shower of blows came furious from <i>Richard's</i>
sword upon the devoted earl's head. Now was
Collier's turn, and bravely did he return them; with
renewed strength <i>Richard</i> rained blows upon blows
so fast that the athletic Jim began to wince&mdash;as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
as to say, 'How long is this going to last?' Nothing
daunted, Collier with both hands clenched his powerful
weapon, but it was only a feather upon Booth's
sword. Jim was the first to show evidence of exhaustion,
and no wonder, nothing could withstand the
trip-hammer blows of that <i>Richard</i>. Watching for
his head's protection, he was too unmindful of his
heels, and before he was aware of it, the doughty Jim
for once was discomfited&mdash;beaten; and lay upon his
back in the orchestra, where the maddened Booth had
driven him.</p>

<p>"The fight over, the curtain descended, but Booth
could not rise. Many believed him dead, but no!
there was the hard breathing and the glazed, open eye.
Could it be possible this was the man who only a few
moments before nobody could withstand in his fury;
now a limp mass of exhausted nature, his nerves all
unstrung, and whom a child might conquer?</p>

<p>"Well, the piece, as may be imagined, was a success&mdash;a
positive and an unqualified success, so much
so that it was kept on the balance of the week. "The
Robbers" was called for rehearsal next, and as usual the
war (then in progress) was the sole topic of conversation.
The company was pretty evenly divided on
the question, a majority of them having played throughout
the South, and had the same sympathy that the merchant
had who saw his trade diverted through other
channels. Not a word of politics was ever heard from
Booth during the first week of his engagement,
although he was an attentive listener to the angry discussions
pro and con., till one morning somebody (I
forget who) read aloud from a newspaper of the arrest
of Marshal George P. Kane in Baltimore, and his
incarceration in Fort McHenry by order of Stanton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
One of the company (now dead) who shall be nameless,
approved heartily of the act, and denounced the
entire city of Baltimore as a hot-bed of rebels, and
should be razed to the ground. His opponent took
an entirely different view of the question, and thought
the levelling to the earth should be done to one Edwin
Stanton by the aid of a pistol shot. The unfortunate
Lincoln's name was never mentioned. At the suggestion
of shooting Stanton, a voice, tremulous with
emotion, at the back of the stage was heard to exclaim.
'Yes, sir, you are right!' It was Booth's.
'<i>I know</i> George P. Kane well; he is my friend, and the
man who could drag him from the bosom of his family
for no crime whatever, but a mere suspicion that he
<i>may</i> commit one some time, deserves a dog's death!'</p>

<p>"It was not the matter of what he said, it was the
manner and general appearance of the speaker, that
awed us. It would remind you of Lucifer's defiance
at the council. He stood there the embodiment of
evil. But it was for a moment only, for in the next
breath with his sharp, ringing voice, he exclaimed,
'Go on with the rehearsal!'</p>

<p>"That day and its events passed from memories of
the majority of us, but I never could forget the scene;
the statuesque figure of the young man uttering those
few words in the centre of the old stage of Wallack's
can never be forgotten. Some months after I was
awakened from a sound sleep and told that President
Lincoln had been shot. Half dazed I inquired when,
and where, and being told, asked who was the assassin?
Wilkes Booth is thought to be, but it is only a
supposition that he is the guilty one. I felt it was but
too true, for I could see him in my mind's eye as upon
that day in the old theatre when he would have undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
any task, however bold. A few hours after
proved the rumor to be true. The last act of the
tragedy all are familiar with, and one day standing at
the grave outside of Baltimore where all that is mortal
of father and son lie, I could not stifle memories of
the past, and felt like dropping a tear of pity over the
sudden and early downfall of one so promising, that
had he lived might now be delighting nightly thousands
with his powerful acting."</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SUMMER VACATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The close of a theatrical season, which rarely exceeds
forty weeks, and which terminates in the month of June,
is always hailed by the prosperous actor as an occasion
when he can find enjoyment and rest in some cosy
spot; or if he is in the ranks, and is ambitious to be
reckoned in the constellation of dramatic stars, he
looks forward to his summer vacation as a time in
which he will have opportunity to fix up his business
for the coming season; or if he has not yet secured
a manager&mdash;probably needing one with money&mdash;he
can button-hole the financiers of the "Square," as
the meeting-place and mart of the theatrical fraternity
of the entire continent is termed. The stars are
becoming so numerous, and, indeed, so insignificant,
that even members of the variety profession with the
thinnest pretensions in the world to dramatic distinction,
and there are few on the legitimate stage above
the ranks of utility, who have not aspirations of the
same bright and twinkling kind. The beginning of
every season finds a hundred or more new combinations,
with little talent and less money, starting out
on the road; and one, two, or three weeks brings
them back, either "on their baggage," or "on their
uppers,"&mdash;that is, the railroad company carries them
home and holds the baggage for their fares, or they
"count the railroad ties," which is a metaphoric way
of saying they walk home. Very few of the cheap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
variety artists of the present day are worthy of even
a mean place in the "legit.," as they designate the
legitimate stage; and it may be said, too, that some
stars who have succeeded in reaching the legitimate
boards would scarcely be reckoned bright ornaments
among the gems of the variety stage. This, however,
is a subject beyond the purposes of this work, and so
I will not go further into it.</p>

<p>The actor and actress who have settled down to the
regular routine of general work are among the persons
who get most enjoyment for their money during their
summer vacation. Stars, male and female alike, who
have made money and reached a satisfactory round on
the ladder of fame, though they may not have cottages
by the seaside, or summer residences of anything
like a pretentious character, can also be counted
among the number who "loaf and invite their
souls" in a profitable and pleasurable manner. Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
of the male stars have nice little nooks by river, lake,
or seaside, in quiet, cool, and shady spots, while the
tragediennes and comediennes of prominence and fortune
seem to prefer either handsome residences in New
York or other Eastern metropolis, or else a watering-place
cottage. Maggie Mitchell prefers Long Branch.
So does Mary Anderson, who lives a very secluded life
at this gay resort. Most of her time is passed in playing
with her little step-sister on the lawn of their
pretty place. She rides on horseback a great deal, and
takes an occasional short cruise on her new yacht,
"The Galatea," which she has named after the latest
role added to her repertoire. Minnie Palmer, about
the only real rival Lotta has got, summers at Long
Branch. Emma Abbott goes to Cape Ann. Lester
Wallack devotes himself and his vacation to making
short trips in his steam yacht. John McCullough
hasn't settled down anywhere yet. Last year he went
to England to work and win a London reputation;
this year he is with Gen. Sheridan in the Yellowstone
Valley. Fred. Marsden likes to go fishing at Salmon
Lake. McKee Rankin has a stock farm at Bois Blanc,
Canada, where he spends his summers. John W.
Norton flies away to Coney Island, Long Branch, and
a round of the Eastern watering-places, Mrs. Norton
always accompanying him. And so the category
might be lengthened out. But it is useless. Established
stars have established fortunes as well as reputations
only by dint of the hardest, and, I might add,
in many cases, least appreciated kind of work, and
they deserve the thousands of dollars they make every
year. Few of the great stars fall less than $50,000
for a forty weeks' season, and there are few whose
share goes under $1,000 a week. Joe Emmet accumulates
money faster, probably, than any other man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
plays to the same prices, and John McCullough and
Mary Anderson are among the reapers of the richest
harvests. Booth seldom plays a season through, but
when he does he, of course, carries off the honors.</p>

<p>Actors and actresses, while generous as a class, save
their money, and very few are found loitering around New
York "broke," during the vacation months. Still there
are cases of poverty. I have known a former popular
Irish comedian, who belongs to a family of popular
and prosperous members of the profession, to walk
the streets of a Western town many a day without a
cent in his pockets and nothing to look up to at night
for shelter but the stars high and pitiless over his bald
head. Everybody has read about the English actor,
who, driven to distress, and standing at the door of
starvation, donned an old gray wig, and was found
singing and begging around Union Square. It was
only when a policeman in arresting him accidentally
pulled off his wig that the actor's identity and condition
were known. The former was carefully concealed
and the latter cheerfully and liberally relieved. I was
at a banquet given by the press of St. Louis to Thomas
W. Keene, the tragedian, during his first starring season,
when among the few guests who sat down to the
table, between Billy Crane and Stuart Robson, was a
short, stout, gray-headed, and long gray-bearded man,
whom nobody knew. The night was bitterly cold,
still the old fellow wore only a long, gray linen duster
over a thin, red woollen shirt, with a very queer pair of
pantaloons and rough brogans. His high, battered
and wide-brimmed hat rested under his chair as if he
was afraid some of the company would steal it. He
swept clean every dish set before him, emptied every
glass of wine, and with bent head, and knife and fork
in hand, was waiting anxiously for each course when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
came. As soon as he was noticed the question passed
around, "Who is the old gray?" and fun was poked
at him ruthlessly; but it rebounded lightly from the
folds of his linen duster, and he heeded not the blows.
When the toasts went around the old man was asked
to respond to one, and got up and spoke charmingly
for half an hour or more, introducing the Marseillaise,
both as a martial hymn, and as a song and dance.
Then he explained how the city editor of a local paper
had sent him to report the banquet; how he came shivering
to the marrow of his bones to the door of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>Club House&mdash;the most fashionable in the city&mdash;and
asked permission to go into the kitchen to warm himself
previous to appearing at the banquet board, a permission
which was granted. The old man spoke so
eloquently in telling a pitiful story of his poverty, Pat
Short, treasurer of the Olympic, at the instigation, I
think, of Manager Norton of the Grand Opera House,
picked up a hat and took up a collection from the
ten newspaper men and ten actors present. The collection
netted $39.75, which was poured in the old
man's two hands, while his eyes were wet with tears.
Then he was freely plied with wine, and danced, sang,
and gave phrenological examinations for two hours,
when the crowd dispersed in the greatest good humor.
Stuart Robson told this story to a Boston <i>Times</i> man
who made a two-column article out of it that travelled
all over the country, and in which all the credit of the
charity with the figures greatly increased was appropriated
unjustly, by Messrs. Robson &amp; Crane. But
this is not what I started out about.</p>

<p>"While the actor seeks deep shadows under the far-reaching
arms of huge trees," writes the New York
<i>Dramatic Times</i> man, "or leisurely smokes his pipe
beneath heavy boughs, thick with scented buds and blossoms,
some one is working out his programme for the
next season. This 'some one' is often confounded
with the actor himself, or is taken for the parasite who
fosters and thrives on some indirect vein of the living
and active theatrical body. The sturdy man of business,
who by chance happens to pass the pavement
between Broadway and Fifth Avenue, on the south
side of Union Square, fancies that the crowd of well-dressed
and, as a rule, quiet men, are idle professionals,
lounging away a warm day between gossip
and beer. He little knows that this is the theatrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
exchange of the Western World, where business is
carried on in the same honorable mode as at the
Stock Exchange, without the Bedlam noises, and that
the seeming drifters under the grateful shade of the
Morton House are as shrewd in looking at the run of
the theatrical market as any Wall Street broker.
Every theatre or nomadic attraction throughout the
United States has, at some time during the day, a
'some one' looking out for 'dates' and 'booking'
memoranda for future contracts. Without any
agreement to meet or transact business, the 'some
one' appears with the June roses and makes it a point
to pass the Rialto between the hours of ten <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> and
four <span class="smcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> The affairs of this exchange are gigantic
(when for instance one manager gives <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bona fide</i> evidence
that he has cleared $40,000 in the past season),
and though it would be impossible to make an estimate
of the total amount, it is safe to say that millions are
the result of these seemingly casual meetings.</p>

<p>"A guide published last year gives a total of about
four thousand five hundred theatres, that kept open
their doors for an average of forty weeks. Taking
the poor attraction, with the star that fills the theatre
to overflowing, the average receipts would be about
$150 for each theatre, or $675,000 paid every night
for amusements throughout the United States. This
would make a total for one week, of $4,050,000, or,
for the entire season of forty weeks, $162,000,000, not
counting matinees. Taking, then, an industry that
brings in over $160,000,000 in round numbers during the
season, the neatly dressed men that are said to 'hang
around the Square' are the men that control or pull
the wires and set the machinery in motion. The figures
above are, after all, but approximate, and neither
include matinees, which in themselves would count one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
million, nor does it include the circus world, which is
not represented on the Rialto.</p>

<p>"On the other side of the ledger will be found
twenty-eight thousand actors drawing their salaries
from these receipts; and about twelve thousand more,
consisting of carpenters, property-men, scene-shifters,
the employees of the front of the theatre, etc. Twenty
dollars a week each would make a fair average for the
entire forty thousand, and would aggregate a total of
$32,000,000 in salaries alone. Add to this the rent
of the four thousand five hundred different theatres
and halls which, at a moderate calculation of say
$4,000 each, would make $18,000,000 for the year.</p>

<p>"The season having closed, actors seek secluded
spots, revel in the enjoyment of flannel shirts and
country life, enjoying a <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">dolce far niente</i> either by seashore
or in wooded glens, and are described as 'resting.'
In the nooks many have charming households,
and under their roof-trees happiness reigns, without
much reference to 'shop.' The manager or agent,
however, as soon as one season ends, procures his
'booking' book and starts for the Square. His plan
may be to play his attraction in the South. The end
of his route will then likely be New Orleans. After
having his date in that city, he will 'fill up' his time
going and coming back. If the attraction be good, he
fills his time by playing in larger cities for one week;
if not, he makes one or two-night stands, which, interpreted,
means that his company plays for one or two
nights in a city. Starting in September, he works his
way down by Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington,
and then in the beaten route through Richmond, Memphis,
Atlanta, etc. This route fixing shows the experienced
manager; for should he, for instance, have
the week commencing February 1st in New Orleans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
he would have a night in Mobile, Alabama, before
reaching there. To a new man the Mobile manager
might offer Saturday, giving the company time to
reach New Orleans on Monday. If this be accepted,
it would show inexperience in the route maker, as the
fashionable night at Mobile is Friday, Saturday being
'niggers'' night. He should so time it as to reach
Mobile on Friday, play that night to big business, have
his matinee, and do the best he could with Saturday
night. In other sections of the country he must know
when the workman's pay-day is. In the oil and mining
regions, for instance, the men are paid but every fortnight.
The attraction which reaches there soonest
after the pay-day fares the best.</p>

<p>"Another of the grave considerations is the question
of railroad fares. All but the big attractions must
take into serious consideration the general increase of
railroad rates to the profession. Some of the roads
have not joined in the pool, and still cater to theatrical
custom. The cities on these routes are likely to have
a rush of attractions this season, and, as a consequence,
will before long yield poor receipts. At any rate there
is a tendency, even among the best-paying companies,
to take short 'jumps' this season (1882&ndash;3) and visit
cities that would have been passed over with contempt
a short time since. But the difference of travelling
expenses one or three hundred dollars in a day, with a
company of forty people, dragging extra baggage,
means a big difference in profits.</p>

<p>"The man on the Square has to look out for all
these things, as well as the printing of the company,
one of the most important and expensive items of
a travelling company, an item which will often make
him pass wakeful days and sleepless nights. These
contracts, of course, vary for the different organizations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
The big theatrical gun as well as the smallest,
either personally or through agents, keeps himself
posted of the affairs of the Rialto. No matter as to
how heavy calibre the big gun may be, he may tell his
friend he don't visit the Square, but he does, or is
sure to let it be known that he lives at the Union
Square Hotel, or at some other hotel near by, where
his booking is done. Managers of provincial theatres,
eager to fill the time for their houses, travel eastward
to the Mecca of theatredom, or have their booking
done by local agents or firms engaged in this city in
that specialty&mdash;the commission for an attraction
being from $5 to $7. One firm of this kind in Union
Square do the booking for more than fifty theatres,
while another and larger one in Twenty-third Street
controls entire circuits, and furnishes attractions for
several hundred theatres. The manager having laid the
foundation of his plan, takes the summer to complete
it, changing a town here, or a date there, to make his
route as complete as possible, and as convenient to
travel over, so as to reach a town and have his company
rest before appearing.</p>

<span class="subhead">FUN AMONG THE ELKS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The benevolent and protective order of Elks is a
mystic organization whose membership is made up almost
entirely of theatrical people, newspaper men,
and people who have some claim or other on the dramatic
profession. It is a noble institution, having for
its foundation those grand and beautiful principles&mdash;friendship,
charity, and justice. Every prominent
actor in the country is found on its rolls, and the good
work it accomplishes from one year to another is
extensive, and worthy the widest recognition. The
only thing I have to find fault with is its initiation business.
Being a jolly, fun-loving set, every candidate
is put through in the liveliest kind of style. I had a
friend, a low comedian named Jughandle, who got me
to be an Elk, and I think they put up an unusually interesting
bill for my initiation. In fact, I don't think it
was a genuine Elk initiation at all, but it was awful
funny for those who witnessed, and not a bit pleasant
for me.</p>

<p>It was Sunday afternoon when I was introduced to
the mysteries of this Order. The first person I met in
the ante-chamber of the lodge room was an officer
called the Outer Spyglass. He ordered two strange
Elks to lead me away to another room where I was
blindfolded, and a long gown was thrown over me. A
large red box, coffin-shaped, with hinges in the middle
of the back, and a round hole in the middle of the split<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
lid, so that by opening the box, adjusting a man's
neck to the place intended for it, and then closing the
box again, the contrivance became the ghastliest sort
of a pillory. There were arm openings in the sides of
the coffin and the lower portion which had been sawed
short was not boarded up, so that the legs might be as
free as possible under the circumstances, in walking.
Into a wooden overcoat of this kind I was hurriedly
thrust, with my head protruding through the hole in
the lid. The garment had been built for a man with a
longer and thinner neck than mine, and its proportions
were so entirely out of keeping with my physique,
that while I was choking, and my spinal column
threatened to crack any minute, my arms and legs
were suffering the severest torture. It was certainly
a comfort to know that dead people do not as a general
thing wear their ligneous ulsters in this style.
When I had the overcoat on, the attendants tied a
piece of rope around my neck, a three-pound prayer-book
was placed in my right hand, and a euchre deck
of cards in my left. Being ready for the sacrifice, one
of the Elks was delegated to introduce me to the
Order. He took hold of the rope that hung from my
neck and hauled me up to the door at which the Grand
Microscope stands guard.</p>

<p>"The candidate is ready," said the outer Spy-Glass.</p>

<p>"Let him enter!" was the Microscope's command.</p>

<p>Trembling and helpless, I stood at last, a picture of
the utmost ridiculousness and misery, in the presence
of the High, Mighty and Magnificent Muck-a-Muck of
the Order.</p>

<p>"Quivering candidate!" the Muck-a-Muck exclaimed.
"The Elks give you greeting. Every person
here assembled stretches out his right hand to you, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
the champion Indian-Club Swinger will now give you,
in one solid chunk, the congratulations of this entire
gathering for the success that promises to attend your
attempt to enter our Order. Club-Swinger, congratulate!"</p>

<div id="ip_155" class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
  <img src="images/i_504.jpg" width="280" height="416" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A CANDIDATE IN REGALIA.</div></div>

<p>The Club-Swinger did so. It was the most startling
congratulation I was ever the recipient of. If a train of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
cars travelling at the rate of 100 miles an hour had run
into me I could not have been more surprised. A blow
that would have made a pile driver or a quartz hammer
feel that it had no more force than the hind leg of a
house-fly was planted on the coffin lid right over the
first button of my vest, and for three minutes I sped
through space. When I landed on my back I felt as if
I had run against another such blow speeding in an
opposite direction to the first. Every bone in my body
was jarred to my finger tips and toe-nails, and the
wrench my neck got in the sudden stoppage gave me
the impression that my spine had been all at once
lengthened out sixteen feet and was still growing.</p>

<p>"Potential Pill-Prescriber!" the High Muck-a-Muck
commanded, "examine the candidate's condition
and immediately report upon the same! How has he
stood the congratulation?"</p>

<p>The Master Physician felt my pulse, muttered to himself
"14,&mdash;48,&mdash;96,&mdash;135," and answered "He has
stood it well, your Majesty."</p>

<p>"Then let him thrice make the circuit of the Peculiar
Circle!" was the next command.</p>

<p>Several Elks helped me to my feet, and after gathering
up the scattered euchre deck and restoring it and
the prayer-book to my outstretched hands, the first
attendant seized the rope still dangling from my neck,
and led me on a rapid trot around the lodge room.
Wherever I passed heavy blows were rained upon my
coffin covering, and I imagined I heard several half-suppressed
laughs among my tormentors. I was beginning
to get mad and had about made up my mind to
throw off the wooden yoke I was carrying around, tear
the bandage from my eyes, and sail in and punch the
heads of half-a-dozen Elks, when I was pounced upon,
dragged to the floor and roughly relieved of the coffin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
I felt better after this and calmly awaited the next
move.</p>

<p>"Bring the candidate before the throne," was the
next command of the High Muck-a-Muck.</p>

<p>With the assistance of a few Elks I succeeded in
reaching a spot where we stopped, and which, I suppose,
was right in the midst of the radiance that hovers nearest
the presiding officer's throne. It is needless to say
that I felt very badly, and I must have looked frightful,
especially when, as happened just then, somebody
clapped a demolished stove-pipe hat on my head to add
to my already ridiculous aspect. I had hopes, however,
that the end was near; but I was sadly mistaken.</p>

<p>"Now, trembling neophyte," said the High Muck-a-Muck,
in very impressive tones, "the most important
part of our ceremony still remains. Hitherto you have
had all the fun; from this time on the fun will be on the
side of the assembled Elks. Let the Grand Microscope
search the candidate. See that he has no life-preserver
under his vest, or pre-Raphælite panel of sole leather
concealed in that portion of his pantaloons to which
the hind straps of his suspenders are fastened."</p>

<p>"He is entirely defenceless, your Majesty," reported
the Grand Microscope, after having made the necessary
examination.</p>

<p>"Then let him learn the three motions through which
every Prophet passes before attaining to the grand
secrets of our Order. Let him test the swiftness of
the Descent, the roughness of the Path of Progress, and
the suddenness of the Upward flight to glory, and the
possession of the everlasting talisman. When this has
been done, if the candidate still lives, prepare, my
mystic brethren, to welcome him into your circle."</p>

<p>My attendants now dealt with me very kindly. I
hardly knew what to think of the easy, almost respectful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
manner in which they took me by the arm as we
walked along. Not a word was said. Silence intense
as that which wields a spell over an audience while some
daring act is in progress on the flying trapeze, seemed
to surround me. As we walked I felt that there was
the slightest bit of a rise&mdash;a gradual going upward&mdash;to
my path. I paid little attention to this, however,
because I was receiving unusually kind treatment at the
time. I had just made up my mind that I had passed
all the perilous places along the road, and was about to
mutter to myself a mixture of thanks and self-gratulations
for the security and comparative blissfulness of
my condition, when, with surprising suddenness, my
attendants caught me by the arms and legs, gave me a
gentle waft forward, and then, reversing the motion,
clapped me upon a rough plank at a very steep incline,
down which I shot like lightning, regardless of the
splinters that ran up into the tenderest portions of my
pantaloons, and occasionally went on short and sharp
expeditions into the neighborhood of my backbone.
Down! Down!! Down!!! I slid, until I thought I had
started from the top end of Jacob's ladder, away up
beyond the furtherest space through which the tiniest
stars twinkle, and was on a rapid and important journey
to the centre of the earth. I kept on thinking this way
until, for a moment, there was a cessation of the splinter
annoyance upon that portion of my anatomy on which
I usually do my sleighing. I felt myself falling, and
then I felt myself stop. The force of gravitation was
never before so fully and satisfactorily impressed upon
me. I got so heavy when I had no further to go that
I nearly crushed my life out with my own weight, and
the sitting down was done with such alacrity that a
pile-driver couldn't have sent the splinters that clung
to my pantaloons further into my flesh. Add to this that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
the first thing I struck was not a spring mattress, or a
high hair cushion, but a wheel-barrow, filled with small
wooden cones, with sharp edges and cruel points. The
shock caused me to send up such a howl that I imagined
I could see the hair of every Elk in the land standing on
end. A well-defined laugh answered the howl, and
before I could think of the front end of the prayers for
the dead, I heard the High Muck-a-Muck's voice ring
<span class="locked">out:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Wing him away," he commanded, "on Eincycle,
the one-wheeled horse of the Hereafter."</p>

<div id="ip_156" class="figleft" style="width: 102px;">
  <img src="images/i_508.jpg" width="102" height="229" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">MUCK-A-MUCK.</div></div>

<p>They wung me away at once. I discovered that the
one-wheeled horse designated by the High Muck-a-Muck
when he made use of the half
German and half Latin word in his
command was a very modern wheel-barrow.
The road over which the
winging was done was, to say the
least, an unpleasant one. There
was an obstruction of some kind
every six inches&mdash;hills and hollows
without number&mdash;and, even if I had
not already been physically shattered
by the exciting episodes of the first
part of the initiation, the merciless
jolting I got and the sharp-pointed
cones I kept dancing up and down
on were sufficient torture to make
me long for some quiet, peaceful spot
on which I might stretch out my wearied limbs and close
my eyes forever. I don't know how far I was carried over
this rough road, which terminated in a tank of chilly
water, into which I was unceremoniously dumped,
while a shout went up from the assembled brotherhood
that indicated that they were highly delighted over my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
prospects of being drowned. After sinking three
times without any apparent effort having been made to
rescue me, I evinced a disposition to remain under
water. I was beginning to fill up rapidly, and celestial
visions were already flitting before me, when
something sharp ran through my shoulder and I felt
myself lifted to the water's surface.</p>

<p>"See that he remains blindfolded," shouted the
High Muck-a-Muck, and, while I still dangled from an
iron hook on the end of a stout pole, the dripping
handkerchief was tightened across my eyes.</p>

<p>"Put him through the Purgation rite," was the
next order, in accordance with which I was thrown,
face forward, upon a barrel, and one Elk taking me by
the heels while another held my head, I was rolled
and rolled until I had passed through one of the most
violent spells of sea-sickness anybody ever experienced.</p>

<p>"Will the candidate recover?" asked the High
Muck-a-Muck.</p>

<p>"I have some hopes, your Majesty," answered the
Potential Pill-Prescriber.</p>

<p>"Then bring in the Krupp gun," the Muck-a-Muck
commanded, "and while he still has life, let the candidate
climb the cloud-heights around which many a
Prophet has soared."</p>

<p>I was trembling with cold up to the time the High
Muck-a-Muck mentioned the Krupp gun; just then a
chill of fear ran down my back and my knees knocked
together so violently that I could hear the bones rattle.
The great cannon was rolled in and placed in position
near where I stood.</p>

<p>"Spread the merciful net three hundred yards
away," ordered the High Muck-a-Muck, "and sprinkle
the carpet in its centre with fourteen papers of tacks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
Place the sheet-iron bumper ten yards beyond, to prevent
the candidate from being shot out of bounds.
Charge the cannon with thirty pounds of powder; load
her up and let her fly!"</p>

<p>They poured the thirty pounds of powder into the
huge mouth of the cannon, rammed down an iron or
steel plate, and then to my horror, grabbed me and
pushed me into the piece of ordnance until my feet
rested on the metallic plate and my head barely protruded
from the top of the war-engine. Buckets of
chopped ice were poured in to fill up the vacant space,
and before the congealed wadding was all in, my toes
and fingers were completely frost-bitten. When everything
seemed to be in readiness the High Muck-a-Muck
<span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"The candidate has no hat on. Fish his plug out
of the lake, put an air-cushion inside and then decorate
his head with it."</p>

<p>The "air-cushion" referred to was only a blown
bladder. It was placed in the top of my bruised and
battered wet hat, which was tightly and gracefully
placed upon my head.</p>

<p>"Is he ready?" shouted the High Muck-a-Muck.</p>

<p>"He is," was the Grand Microscope's answer.</p>

<p>"Then, let her go!"</p>

<p>Fiz! boom!! bang!!! I knew the match was at
the fuse; felt the whole business give way; heard the
scream of the powder leaving the cannon at the same
moment as myself; saw the flash of fire as it burned
my eyebrows, moustache and the ends of my hair; had
my breath swept away by the swiftness of my flight,
and while all these experiences were mingled in one
instantaneous jumble in my mind, whack went my
head against the sheet-iron bumper; bang! went the
explosive bladder in my hat, and, hurled back by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
recoil, I fell right in the middle of the carpet space in
the merciful net, just back in the midst of the fourteen
papers of tacks that had been sprinkled there for my
benefit. I howled and jumped into the air, but every
time I jumped I fell back again and got a fresh invoice
of tacks in my flesh. Although there seemed to be
nothing particularly mirth-provoking in my situation,
the assembled Elks laughed heartily until I was stuck
as full of carpet tacks as a boiled ham is of cloves at a
pastry-cook's ball. Then they took me out of the
net, picked the tacks out of my back, and stood me
up, weak and exhausted, according to instructions, in
front of the throne.</p>

<p>"The candidate," said the High Muck-a-Muck,
"has given satisfactory evidence of his fortitude and
endurance, and we are now prepared to receive him
forever into our number as an Elk. Let him take
the oath and kiss the branching antlers."</p>

<p>The oath was administered and I saluted the antlers
with my lips as fervently as I could under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"Now remove the blindfold."</p>

<p>The handkerchief was removed from my eyes and I
saw&mdash;nothing. But I was an Elk.</p>

<p>I have seen many candidates initiated into this Order
since that time, but I have never seen any such proceeding
as that here described, which leads me to infer
that some friends, and among them Jughandle, put
up a job on me and used me a little roughly, for the
sake of the sport it afforded them.</p>

<p>A "disengaged canvasman" who was probably
driven to poetry for lack of other work wrote the following
spring verses which were published in the New
York <i>Clipper</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">In the spring the gorgeous banners float upon the circus tent,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And I think I hear the landlord, coming up to ask for rent!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>There is more fact than poetry in these lines. The
spring brings gaily colored posters, like flowers of
many hues, to decorate the dead walls and fences; and
litters the streets with small hand-bills in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
wonders of the evening show are dwelt upon in a style
of rhetoric that would make George Francis Train
sick. The name of the show is too long to print in
this book, even if I began at the title-page and wrote
small and close through every page down to the lower
right-hand corner of the back cover. Since they got
to consolidating shows, they have by some elastic
process begun to lengthen out the name, and at every
reappearance of a circus in a town the bill-poster must
add a few yards to the length of his fence to get the
improved and newly elongated name on it, and to make
a few square yards of additional space for the fresh
stock of impossible pictures the artist has chopped
out for the show. I like to regard the ridiculous art
and the brazen exaggeration of these posters. What
consummate impertinence prompts the managers of
these concerns to put a circus on paper that could
never have an existence under the sun is something
that it is impossible to understand. They ask and they
must have the patronage of the public they insult by
spreading such absurdities upon the wall as the picture
of one horse lying on his back with his legs up and
another horse standing above him, their eight hoofs
meeting; or of a man being blown from the mouth of
a cannon, or indeed any of the other ridiculous and
gaudy illustrations which are designed to catch the eye
at a distance of one hundred yards and to hold the attention
long enough to make the investigator of bill-board
literature part with a half dollar. But it seems
that circus managers and circus agents have no other
idea of advertising than to make the ink and the colors
on their posters say as much as the imagination can suggest,
and to make people pay for the privilege of finding
out that they have been bamboozled. It seems to
be remunerative though, for a circus can create greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
commotion in a town than a big fire, and from the moment
it pitches its tents&mdash;a city of canvas, they usually
call it&mdash;until the glory of the visit fades, thousands
are interested in it and the opening of its doors always
finds a throng with tickets in hand anxious to get inside
as early as possible, to have a thorough look at
the menagerie and in the other way, by putting in full
time to get their money's worth out of the show.</p>

<p>The circus always comes to town with a flourish.
There is a grand street parade. The dozen elephants
and sixteen camels follow the band wagon, and then
comes the cavalcade, gentlemen in court costumes and
ladies in rich trailing robes with jaunty hat of gay
ribbons and feathers flying in the breeze. The lion
tamer is in the cage with the feeble animals that he
keeps stirring up with his whip; the clown in his little
chariot with his trick mule, affords amusement to
the children along the line; then the snake charmer
rolls by fondling the slimy reptiles, and after that
comes a procession of red wagons with trampish
drivers in red coats, and perhaps there are some grotesque
figures on top of the wagons. At the rear some
enterprising clothier has an advertising vehicle. That
is about all there is to it, if we add the Undine wagon
that has a place sometimes at the head and sometimes
in the middle of this "gorgeous street pageant."
Still it goes from one end of town to the other, scaring
horses and creating the greatest excitement among the
circus-going public. The $10,000 beauty "gag"
that worked so successfully last season when Adam
Forepaugh claimed to have paid that amount to Miss
Louise Montague, a variety actress, for merely appearing
in the street parade, riding on a howdah high
upon the back of his largest elephant and for participating
in the grand entree at the opening of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
performance. Barnum tried to make some free advertising
for himself this season by announcing that he
would pay $10,000 to the handsomest man and
$20,000 to the handsomest lady, but he was shrewd
enough to see that the scheme would not bring him
back $30,000, so he allowed it to fall through.</p>

<p>This subject of costly beauties recalls an incident
that took place in a Western theatre. At the house in
question an actress was performing who, in times gone
by, figured as the faithless sweetheart of an eminent
sport in that very city. That gentleman hearing that
his light of love was about to appear in a new line visited
the theatre to see for himself whether or not it was
really she. The memory of past troubles caused him
to drink rather more than was good for him, and when
he took his seat in the parquette near the stage, he was
in a great measure incapacitated from acting with coolness
and judgment. He believed he recognized the
woman as the one who had caused him so much sorrow
and trouble. His feelings got the better of him, and
standing up in his seat he <span class="locked">exclaimed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"You cost me $25,000, you cost me $25,000, and
I'll cut your d&mdash;d heart out!"</p>

<p>This outcry brought one of the members of the company
to her assistance, armed with a property revolver,
and the air was full of war and rumors of war until
the police arrived. The $25,000 victim was led out
and the play went on.</p>

<p>While the parade is on its way back to the circus
lot, I will tell the reader of an exciting parade that was
witnessed at Runcorn, England, last summer: Messrs.
Sanger &amp; Son, who were exhibiting in the town, had
announced a procession in connection with their great
hippodrome, and from twelve to one o'clock, although
rain was falling very heavily, large crowds of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
began to assemble in the Market Square, Bridge Street
and the wide space in front of the Town Hall and the
public offices. To one very large car forty horses had
been harnessed, to be driven through the town by one
man. This was drawn up waiting for the start, almost
opposite the <i>Guardian</i> office, while higher up Bridge
Street stood twelve ponies harnessed to a smaller car.
Near the Town Hall stood two other cars, and as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
o'clock approached and the rain showed signs of abating,
the procession was expected very shortly to form
and make the circuit of the town. Suddenly, among
the horses standing near to the shop of Messrs. Handley
&amp; Co., there was a great commotion, and loud
shouts were heard to "Clear the road." The twelve
ponies had taken fright and were rushing down Bridge
Street towards the fountain. There was no one in
charge, and it was evident that some very serious accident
would result from the panic which seemed to have
seized the horses. To make matters worse, the forty
horses became frightened, and, with the ponderous car
behind them, joined the ponies in their gallop. Many
persons sought refuge in the shops and doorways.
Those who were not fortunate enough to reach this
shelter were trampled upon and crushed, and the scene
was one of the wildest excitement. At one moment it
seemed as though the great colossal car would be overturned
among the struggling crowd, while the plate-glass
windows in the shops on the south side of the street
were within an inch of being smashed. The scene was
not of long duration, but it lasted long enough to injure
at least ten people and imperil the safety of hundreds
more. When nearing the commissioners' offices,
several constables who were in the court-room, hearing
the noise outside, rushed into the street, and were
just in time to seize the ponies by the heads and turn
them down Mersey Street before they reached the
Royal Hotel. The horses, through the courageous
exertions of the police and some of Messrs. Sanger &amp;
Son's drivers, were brought to a standstill opposite the
Royal Hotel.</p>

<p>Many people affect to be indifferent to the attractions
of the circus, saying that they saw one when they
were young and as all circuses are the same there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
no use in going to see another. These people are
about right. There has been nothing new in the genuine
features of the circus for the past fifty years.
There are a few deceptive tricks that have been seen
only of late years but they are mere ephemeral illusions,
easy of explanation, and time will take them out
of the circus ring as it took the lion-taming act. I
can remember the time when the cage of lions was
dragged into the middle of the arena and amid the
greatest excitement the alleged lion-tamer went in
among the animals, beat them about, lay down upon
the back of one and put his head between the wide-open
jaws of another. Now that performance is lost
sight of among the multitude of curiosities in the
menageries. The great unchangeable features of a
show, the gymnastic, acrobatic and equestrian work, are
the same now that it was a half century ago. Still
with all its want of novelty it is attractive, as are all
shows, and grown people have been known to share
the enthusiasm of the little ones in playing circus after
witnessing a performance and while the sawdust fever
was still on them. A short, funny sketch that appeared
in the Louisville <i>Courier-Journal</i> will do to illustrate
the hold the circus has upon the average boy's heart.
The writer <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"After the circus had opened to the public yesterday
a gray-haired colored brother, who held the hand of a
boy of fourteen as both stood gazing at the tent,
shook his head in a solemn manner, and <span class="locked">observed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"'It's no use to cry 'bout it, sonny, kase we am
not gwine in dar no how.'</p>

<p>"'But I want ter,' whined the boy.</p>

<p>"'In course you does. All chill'en of your aige
run to evil an' wickedness, an' dey mus' be sot down
on by dose wid experience.'</p>

  <div class="caption">ADAM FOREPAUGH.</div></div>

<p>"'You used to go,' urged the boy.</p>

<p>"'Sartin I did, but what was de result? I had sich
a load on my conscience dat I couldn't sleep nights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>
I cum powerful nigh bein' a lost man, an' in dem days
de price of admishun was only a quarter, too.'</p>

<p>"'Can't we both git in for fifty cents?'</p>

<p>"'I 'speck we might, but to-morrer you'd be bilin'
ober wid wickedness an' I'd be a backslipper from de
church. Hush up, now, kase I hain't got but thirty
cents, and dar am no show fur crawlin' under de
canvas.'</p>

<p>"The boy still continued to cry, and the old man
pulled him behind a wagon, and continued:</p>

<p>"'Henry Clay Scott, which had you rather do&mdash;go
inter de circus an' den take de awfullest lickin' a
boy eber got, or have a glass of dat red lemonade an'
go to Heaben when you die? Befo' you decide let me
explain dat I mean a lickin' which will take ebery inch
of de hide off, an' I also mean one of dem big glasses
of lemonade. In addishun, I would obsarve dat a
circus am gwine on in Heaben all de time, an' de price
of admisshun am simply nominal. Now, sah, what
do you say?'</p>

<p>"The boy took the lemonade, but he drank it with
tears in his eyes."</p>

<p>A man living near Bloomington, Illinois, in 1870,
sold his stove to a neighbor to obtain funds to take
his family to a circus that had pitched its tents near
the city. When he got back he said he was not a bit
sorry, that "he'd seen the clown, an' the gals a ridin',
an' the fellows doin' flip-flaps, an' waz so perfectly
satisfied that ef another suck-cus came along next
year, an' he had a stove, he'd go to see it on the same
terms ag'in."</p>

<span class="subhead">UNDER THE CANVAS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The one great wish of the small boy's heart, as he
stands at a respectful distance from the ticket wagon
watching the huge canvas rise and sink&mdash;apparently
with as much ease as the flag flies from the top of the
centre-pole&mdash;is to get inside the tent before the band
begins to play. He may not have a cent to pay the
admission, but he has Micawberish hopes that far
surpass any money value that might be placed upon a
small boy, that something will turn up to gain him
admission to the show. He knows that if the canvas-men
give him a good chance he can crawl in under the
cloth and make his way up through the seats. He
has been told that if he is caught at such a trick the
showmen will drag him to the dressing-tent and fill
his hair full of powdered sawdust. The canvas-men
are, however, vigilant; besides that, they are lazy
and do not care to move around, so the small boy
must be content to throw hand-springs in the sawdust-sprinkled
lot, and keep on hoping until the show is
out. In this respect the minute boy does not betray
the same shrewdness credited to a Baltimore girl.
She was on a visit to her brother's ranche near Austin,
Texas, when a small circus came along. It is considered
the acme of honesty to beat the circus in
that region&mdash;in fact, paying is heartily deprecated.
Although only a month in the place, the Baltimore
belle was thoroughly imbued with the cowboy spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>
in as far as "beating" the circus was concerned, and
when the show pitched its tents she made up her mind
as to what she was going to do. At night, when
the show was under headway, she calmly approached
the circus tent on stilts, and viewed the first half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
of the performance through the opening between the
canvas and the roof. One of the fighters of the show
detecting something wrong, crept around with a club
to "smash" the intruder, but received a kick in the
eye from the fair stilt performer, and was so taken
aback that the cowboys had time to rally to her support
and raid the show while she at a safe distance
applauded the conquering herders. The troupe left
town that night in a sadly damaged condition.</p>

<p>Until late years circuses generally gave a balloon
ascension before the afternoon performance took
place, and sometimes a slack-wire performance was
added. The latter free exhibition dropped out of sight
a short time ago, and since 1876 there have been few
circus balloon ascensions; they have been abandoned
on account of the danger and frequency of accidents.
Everybody remembers the fate of Donaldson
and Greenwood, the former an æronaut in the employ
of Barnum at the time, the latter, a Chicago newspaper
reporter. They left Chicago July 15, 1875, in a tattered
old balloon. It was a remarkably fine day, and
not the remotest shadow of danger fell across the sunshine.
The balloon was carried out over the lake, disappeared
from view, and the fate of the missing men
was not known until a portion of the tattered balloon
and the body of Greenwood, with his note-book and
other articles that helped to identify him, were found
on the Michigan shore of the great lake. The balloon
had been wrecked and both men had perished in the
waves. Donaldson's body was never recovered. An
imaginary sketch of this fatal trip was written by John
A. Wise, the æronaut, who himself perished in Lake
Michigan while attempting to complete a night ascension.
He and George Burr started from St. Louis at
dusk, and as the ærial ship was vanishing into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
clouds it was seen for the last time. For weeks nothing
was heard of the missing men or the balloon.
They were thought to be lost in the Michigan prairies.
At last Burr's body was found on the east shore of
Lake Michigan. Wise's remains were never recovered.</p>

<p>A lady balloonist met with a terrible death at
Cuantla, Mexico, some time ago. A great crowd assembled
to witness the balloon ascension of Senorita
Catalina Georgio, a beautiful girl only seventeen years
old. There was no car attached to the balloon, only
the trapeze on which the girl performed. The balloon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
shot up amid the deafening cheers of the crowd which
was present. Catalina, meanwhile, was seen clinging
to the trapeze and performing daring feats of agility.
When the balloon was three-quarters of a mile high it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
suddenly exploded and fell to the ground with the unfortunate
girl. Her dead body was found horribly
crushed and mangled beside the wrecked balloon.
The remains were tenderly cared for by the natives.</p>

<p>A frightful balloon accident occurred lately at Courbevoie,
near Paris. A large crowd had assembled to
witness the novel and perilous ascent of a gymnast
called August Navarre, who had volunteered to perform
a number of athletic feats on a trapeze suspended
from a Montgolfier balloon named the Vidouvillaise.
Rejecting the advice of bystanders, Navarre refused
to allow himself to be tied to the trapeze. There was
no car attached to the balloon. At about five o'clock the
Vidouvillaise was let loose from its moorings and rose
majestically in the air. Navarre, hanging on to the
trapeze, appeared quite confident, and repeatedly saluted
the spectators. When, however, the balloon
had reached a height of nearly one thousand yards
the crowd was horrified to see him suddenly let go the
bar and fall. The descent was watched in breathless
excitement. At last the body reached the ground,
striking with such force that it made a hole in the
earth two feet deep, and rebounded four yards. It
was crushed and mangled almost beyond recognition.
Meanwhile the balloon, freed from its human ballast,
shot up with lightning speed, and soon disappeared
from view. Late in the evening it burst and fell at
Menilmontant, much to the consternation of the inhabitants
of that busy Parisian quarter.</p>

<p>The day after Donaldson's fatal ascension, Dave D.
Thomas, then press agent for Barnum, and filling the
same place still, made a successful ascension. Mr.
Thomas is familiar with ballooning, and often laments
that the days of ærial ascensions as circus advertisements
are past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
While waiting for the performance to begin let us
drop into the dressing-tent. It is divided in the middle
by a strip of canvas about seven feet wide, and
this half space is again divided into dressing-rooms,
one for the men, the other for the women. The large
space is the green-room of the circus. It is not only
that, but it is the property-room. The performers are
preparing for the grand entree. Helmets are lying
around loose, and wardrobes appear to be in a state of
great confusion. Cheap velvet gaily bespangled is
quite plentiful. It looks best at a distance. Quantities
of white chalk are brought into use, each man's
face being highly powdered, his eyebrows blackened,
etc. The dressing-room is small and there is apparently
much confusion while the performers are donning
their respective costumes. But each knows what his
duty is, and does it accordingly, without really interfering
with anyone else. On the other side is the
ladies' room; into this we are not permitted to cast
our profane peepers, but we know from exterior
knowledge that paint and powder, short dresses and
flesh tights are rapidly converting ordinary women
into equestrienne angels. Outside of the dressing-rooms
are the horses, ranged in regular order. At a
given signal the riders appear, mount and enter the
ring. As they are dashing about in apparent recklessness
let us look more clearly at them. They all look
young and fresh, but there are old men in the party
who for twenty-five or thirty years have figured in the
sawdust ring. Chalk hides their wrinkles, dyestuffs
their gray hairs, and skull caps their baldness. Yonder
lady who sits her steed gracefully, and who looks
as blooming as a rose on a June morning, is not only
a mother, but a grandmother. And there is George
who was engaged last winter to do "nothing, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>
know." He finds his duties embrace riding, leaping,
tumbling, object-holding, and occasionally in short
times drive a team on the road. There is one rider
who was formerly a manager himself. He had a big
fortune once, but a few bad seasons swamped it, and
he is now glad to take his place as a performer on
a moderate salary. Returning to the dressing-room
after the entree, we find the clown engaged in putting
the finishing touches to his make-up. We must look
closely at him to recognize him. He does not seem to
be the same fellow we met at the breakfast table, in
stylish clothes and a shirt-front ornamented with a
California diamond. He has given himself an impossible
moustache with charcoal, and has painted
bright red spots on his cheeks. You think him a mere
boy as he springs into the ring, but he has been a
mere boy for many a long year, and his bones are getting
stiff and his joints ache in spite of his assumed
agility. The "gags" that he repeats and the songs
that make you laugh are not funny to him, for he has
repeated them in precisely the same inflection for an
indefinite number of nights. He comes out to play
for the principal act of horsemanship. Meantime in the
dressing-room, if it is damp or chilly, the performers
are wrapping themselves in blankets or moving about
to keep warm. When the bareback rider returns from
the ring he usually disrobes, takes a bath and dons his
ordinary attire; but the less important performers
must keep themselves in readiness to render any assistance
which they may be called upon to perform.</p>

<p>There is but little repose for the weary circus people
during a season. Frequently they stay but one day in
a place, and the next town is fifteen or twenty miles
distant. All the properties must be packed up, the
helmets and cheap velvet, the tights and the tunics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
must be stowed away and the journey made by night.
The following day brings a recurrence of the dangers
and toil of circus life.</p>

<p>A clown who was importuned by some young ladies
of Mill City, Iowa, as they passed the dressing-tent, to
let them in, said he'd do it for a kiss from each. There
were four in the party and they held a brief consultation
when they came back and wanted to know if one
kiss wouldn't do.</p>

<p>"Yes, one each," said Mr. Merryman, who had his
paint on and looked anything but pretty.</p>

<p>Again they consulted, and at last agreed. They
were respectable young ladies and were slow to do
anything that might compromise them, still they kissed
the clown, who lifted a flap of the tent and passed in
each as she paid the osculatory fee. The kisses did
his old heart good, and when he went into the ring so
fresh and happy did he feel that he actually got off a
new and good joke, which is an extraordinary thing for
a clown. The clown is pretty much the whole show to
the little folks, and there are many grown people who
cherish fondly the childish admiration they had had for
the retailer of old jokes and singer of poor comic songs.
He talks and jumps around as lightly as if he were a
young man; but often if the reader could be around
when the chalk and the streaks of black and red have
been washed off he would see that the light-hearted
laugh-provoker is an old man wrinkled and gray, and
that he is to be pardoned for not being able to say
anything funny that would be new at his time of life.
I like everything about a clown, his clothes, his comical
hat, his old jokes, his poor voice and his worse
songs. He tries to amuse other people's children, and
therefore I am glad when I hear he has children of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
own, as the following touching story told in verse has

<p>The public at large has but a very vague idea of how
a circus is run, and the people, besides the managers
and regular employees, who make a living by it. When
the tenting season is about to open, a class of people,
who in the winter hang about the saloons, variety
theatres and gambling hells of the large cities, start
for the circuses to bid for what are known as the
"privileges," which are, as a rule, understood to embrace
not only the candy and lemonade-stands and the
side-shows, but all sorts of gambling devices by which
the unsuspecting countryman is fleeced out of his earnings,
or borrowings, as the case may be. Monte men,
thimble-riggers, sweat-cloth dealers, and all classes of
gamblers and thieves who have not yet risen to the
dignity of "working" the watering-places and summer
resorts, look upon the route of a circus as their
legitimate field of operation. The circus proprietor
who rents the lot upon which his tent or tents are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
pitched has the right to sublet such portions of the
ground as he does not use, for such purposes as he
deems proper, and which will not make him personally
amenable to the laws for whatever crimes may be committed
there. It has been shown that in many cases
the managers not only sell to gamblers the privilege of
locating on the ground and robbing the patrons of the
circus, but also receive a share of the ill-gotten wealth.</p>

<p>"There are," said Mr. Coup, the circus owner, to
an interviewer, "lots of shows with big bank accounts
who have made their money by actually robbing their
patrons. They used to swindle on the seats, but that
is done away with now entirely, or nearly so. Of
course, I am not at liberty to mention names, but I
could astonish you by designating shows the managers
of which have made the greater portion of their money
in this way. But a great trick which is being practised
is this: A man is sent ahead of the show who is not
known to have any connection whatever with it. In
fact, he denies that he has anything to do with it, and
yet he is really employed by the managers. This man
canvasses the town and finds some man who has a big
bank account and who is gullible enough to confide in
strangers. The agent makes his acquaintance, gets
into his confidence, and then with a great show of
secrecy informs him how he can make a pile of money
when the circus comes along. The innocent citizen
bites at the bait and is steered against a gambling
scheme either inside or outside of the tent, and loses
often large sums of money. Perhaps he is a man
whose social standing prevents him from making his
loss known, or, more frequently, he fails to suspect the
agent, who blusters around and declares that he, too,
has lost money on the scheme. And thus the show
goes from town to town, making almost as much by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
stealing from its patrons as it does at the ticket wagon.
There are shows which make from $30,000 to $40,000
a season in this way and that goes a good way toward
paying for their printing, and is quite an item. I have
made war on these fellows for years and am determined
to keep it up. If I cannot run a show without having
a lot of gambling schemes attached to it, why then I'll
stop running a show. I abolished everything of the
kind last season, even down to the selling of lemonade
in the seats. I allow lemonade to be sold now, but
the men are watched carefully and the first one caught
swindling my patrons, off goes his head."</p>

<p>"Do you not find it difficult to keep gamblers and
confidence men away from your show?"</p>

<p>"I did at first, but it is now known among them
that I will not allow it and they keep away. My life
has been threatened several times just on account of
this, but I still live and still propose to keep up the
fight. I have been offered as high as $1,000 a week
for the privilege to rob my patrons by camp-followers,
so you can see that the privilege is worth something.
In Georgia a gang threatened publicly to kill me on
sight for refusing to let them hang around my tents,
but some of my men went for them and cleaned them
out very effectually. The side-show privileges are sold
only on condition that no gambling shall be carried on
in the tents and that the patrons shall not be swindled
in any way. The side-shows can be made to pay without
robbery. Last season the side-shows that traveled
with my show, made $75,000, which was more than I
made."</p>

<span class="subhead">ACROBATICS AND EQUESTRIANISM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Nearly every man connected with the ring work of a
circus is an acrobat of one kind or other. His ability
may be limited to turning a single somersault, still he
will be brought into the arena with the rest of the
company and opportunity will be afforded him to do
his best. It is not expected, however, to recruit the
ranks from such a class. Children must be trained to
the profession, and a long and arduous training it
requires. If their parents are professionals their
studies will be all the more severe, and cuffs and blows
will be the only encouragement given their struggling
children. Fathers have been known to beat their sons,
to kick them in the presence of the audience, and to
add other and severer punishment when the young
acrobat reaches home. The Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children could find plenty to do in preventing
brutal parents from abusing their little folks,
if not in putting an end entirely to the swift and rough
training that boys are put through in order that they
may be hired out or leased to circus managers. In
New York I understand that broken-down ring performers
have schools in which boys are taught every
branch of the circus business, just as there are riding
schools where young men and young women may learn
pad-riding and go even as far as riding bareback. The
schools for acrobats are usually conducted by cruel,
heartless fellows who urge the pupils to their tasks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
with a club, and while forgetting to say a kind word
when the pupil has done well, will never fail to say a
harsh one when any mistake has been made. These
places are filled up with all the appliances of a gymnasium&mdash;bars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
ropes, weights, trapezes, tight-rope,
etc. Circus managers in want of talent for small shows
going South or West apply here and take their choice
of the boys. A bargain is quickly made and the child,
for many of them are still mere children, goes forth
to join the throng engaged from April until October in
amusing the public in the sawdust arena.</p>

  <div class="caption">BAREBACK RIDING.</div></div>

<p>When the child gets into the circus ring there need
be hope of no further sympathy. Its task is set and
must be done at all hazards. A failure one time to
accomplish a feat must be followed by another and
another attempt until the feat is at last satisfactorily
presented. Olive Logan was at a circus performance
at Cincinnati at which she witnessed an extraordinary
instance of cruelty on the part of a circus proprietor to
a child rider. The circus was owned and managed by
a certain clown. The clown-proprietor, Miss Logan
goes on to say, introduced a little girl to the audience,
saying that she would exhibit her skill in riding. He
stated that the horse was somewhat unused to the ring
and if it should happen that the rider fell, no one need
entertain any apprehension of serious accident, as the
arena was soft and injury would be impossible. It was
surely an unhappy introduction for the child, and calculated
to fill her with fear and doubt. The child
whirled rapidly round the ring two or three times, using
neither rein nor binding strap. She stood on one
foot, then changed to the other. After this she was
called upon to jump the stretchers. Had her horse
been well trained, the feat would have been no very
difficult one. But she became entangled in the cloth
and fell to the ground, under the horse's feet. She
was placed again on the back of the horse and compelled
once more to try the feat. Her fall had not
given her new confidence and she fell a second time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
Evidently much against her inclination and in spite of
her trembling and her tears, nature's protest against
barbarity, she was tossed again to her place. But her
nerve had gone. She was utterly demoralized. Judgment
of distance, and faith in herself were lost. Again
she attempted to execute
the leap. Again she fell to
the ground, striking heavily
upon her head. She
rolled directly under the
horse's feet and only by
a sheer chance escaped a
terrible death. The audience,&mdash;more
merciful
than those within the ring,
by this time had been
thoroughly aroused and indignant.
Cries and shouts
were heard from all quarters:
"Shame! shame!"
"That'll do!" "Take
her out! take her out!"
came up from every side.
It would not answer to
disregard such commands,
and with a smile the ring
master went to the child,
raised her from the dust
where she lay, and led her, crying and sobbing, to the
dressing-tent.</p>

  <div class="caption">TRAPEZE.</div></div>

<p>The men and women who perform at dizzy heights
on the trapeze and flying rings frequently meet with
terrible accidents. Still the difficulty of these feats is
being constantly increased, and performers, not satisfied
with having their eyes open during their perilous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>
flight from one trapeze to another, envelope their heads
in sacks, and although not wholly blinding themselves,
very materially interfere with the vision, which in all
such instances should not be obstructed. A typical
accident of the trapeze kind happened at a performance
of old John Robinson's circus at South Pueblo, Colorado,
on June 12, 1882. While the Alfredo Family
were performing on the trapeze, the stake which supports
the rope pulled out of the ground, which had
been softened by the afternoon storm, and let the performers&mdash;three
in number, William, Lewis, and his
wife, Emma Alfredo&mdash;suddenly to the ground. The
act is a sort of double bicycle and trapeze performance.
William propels a bicycle back and forth on a line
stretched from pole to pole, and Lewis and Emma
perform on two trapeze-bars suspended from the bicycle.
When the stake pulled up last night the rope
collapsed just at the moment that Lewis was hanging
by his feet from the lower bar and Emma from the
upper, both straight down, with arms folded. Emma
caught herself on the lower bar and the side ropes,
but her husband fell straight to the ground, alighting
on the back of his head, the fall being twelve or fourteen
feet. He was at once removed to his dressing-room,
and the physicians who were summoned said
that his spine was injured. Half an hour later he was
removed to a hotel, where he died at four P.&nbsp;M.,
June 13th.</p>

<p>A gymnast who fell from a trapeze in New Orleans
gave the following account of his sensations: "Amid
the sea of faces before me I looked for a familiar one,
but in vain, and, turning, I stepped back to the rope
by which we ascended to the trapeze, and going up hand
over hand was soon seated in my swinging perch. As
I looked down I caught sight of a face in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span>
boxes, that at once attracted my attention. It was
that of a beautiful girl, with sweet blue eyes, and
golden hair falling unconfined over her shoulders in
heavy, waving masses. Her beautiful eyes, turned
toward me, expressed only terror at the seeming danger
of the performer, and for the moment I longed to
assure her of my perfect safety, but my brother was
by my side and we began our performance. In the
pauses for breath I could see that sweet face, now pale
as death, and the blue eyes staring wide open with
fear, and I dreaded the effect of our finish, which&mdash;being
the drop act&mdash;gives the uninitiated the impression
that both performers are about to be dashed headlong
to the stage. Having completed the double
performance I ascended to the upper bar, and, casting
off the connect, we began our combination feats.
While hanging by my feet in the upper trapeze, my
brother being suspended from my hands (the lower
bar being drawn back by a super), I felt a slight
shock, and the rope began slowly to slip past my foot.
My heart gave a grand jump, and then seemed to stop,
as I realized our awful situation. The lashing which
held the bar had parted, the rope was gliding round
the bar, and in another moment we should be lying
senseless on the stage. I shouted 'under' to the terrified
'super,' who instantly swung the bar back to its
place, and I dropped my brother on it as the last
strand snapped and I plunged downward. I saw the
lower bar darting toward me and I made a desperate
grasp at it, for it was my last chance. I missed it!
Down through the air I fell, striking heavily on the
stage. The blow rendered me senseless and my collar
bone was broken. I was hurried behind the scenes,
and soon came to my senses. My first thought was
that I must go back and go through my performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
at once, and I actually made a dash for the stage&mdash;but
I was restrained, and it was many weeks before I
was able to perform again."</p>

<p>The circus-goers of a decade ago were accustomed
to tight-rope and slack-wire performances in the ring,
when old men and young women, emulative of the celebrated
Blondin, went through some wonderful evolutions
in mid-air. Now the tight-rope and loose wire
have both almost entirely disappeared from the ring,
and only in the small shows are they given a place in
the programme. Still there are many excellent performers
in this line who find employment on the variety
stage among specialty people. The best of these is
Zanfretti, the pantomime clown, who though an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>
man displays wonderful agility when with balance-pole
in hand he finds himself at the half-way point on his
rope. Ladies who have taken to the hempen path
have attained prominence as rope-walkers. One of
the most beautiful and at the same time dangerous, of
the performances that the small shows offer to their
audiences is that of Madame Lasalle, who places her
little eight-year-old daughter in a wheelbarrow filled
with flowers, and on a rope thirty feet above the
ground without net beneath and with nothing but
hard ground to receive both in case of a fall, trundles
the barrow over a long rope while the people below
look up in breathless fear lest the barrow tip and
a dreadful accident result before the feat is accomplished.
Tight-rope walking, however, is not nearly
so difficult as it appears to be. The performer needs
steady nerves, a cool eye, firm limbs and a balance-pole,
the last-named article being the most essential.
Training is required, of course, but it is not of
the rigorous and protracted kind that other feats demand.</p>

<p>The training of riders is not so difficult or attended
with such dangers, although it is perilous enough. If
a circus rider has a son or daughter he wishes to bring
up for the ring he will begin by carrying the child, as
soon as it is strong enough, upon the horse with him,
thus accustoming it to standing upon the animal in
motion; but if a boy or girl is taken up at an age
when it is no longer easy to carry him around the ring
on the back of a horse, he is put in training with what
the circus people call "the mechanic." This is a beam
extending out from a pivoted centre-pole and having a
rope hanging down at the edge of the ring with a strap
at the end which is fastened around the pupil's waist.
The rope is long enough to allow the pupil to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
upon the back of an animal, and by means of its support
he is kept in an upright position until he gets
accustomed to the motion of a horse, and is prevented
from falling should he miss his footing. He begins
with a pad on the back of a gentle animal, and keeps
on with "the mechanic" until he is able to stand
alone on the horse, from which time on the pad is discarded
and the pupil goes it bareback. Ed. Showles,
a good rider and prominent in his line, told me that it
takes about six months to break a boy in so that he
will be able to ride fairly, but that a girl may be taught
in three months.</p>

<p>This training goes on during the winter months
while the circus is in quarters. A small ring is always
a department of the winter quarters, and in this the
trained animals are kept in practice and new ones are
broken in, the whip being freely used upon all in giving
them their lessons. A horse that is intended for
the educated class after having acquired the ordinary
manœuvres, for instance, must learn to get up on his
hind legs and paw the air with the fore legs, as we see
them in pictures of the Ukraine stallions, etc. To do
this the animal must have his haunches strengthened.
By whipping the fore legs he is made gradually to rise
on the hind ones. The horse finds it difficult at first,
but judicious whipping gets him up in the air at last
and the sight of the threatening whip keeps him there
as long as there is strength in his haunches to keep

<p>"The work of the leading equestrienne is one of the
most laborious in the whole range of the circus profession.
It requires physical courage of the highest
order, combined with great power of endurance and a
capacity for adopting oneself to a constant change of
scene and surrounding. People who witness only the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>brilliant performances in the ring in an atmosphere
laden with light and music, little dream of the wearisome
toil and drudgery which precede them."</p>

<p>The speaker was Miss Lilly Deacon, a fair-haired
English lady, with the form of a Juno, who arrived in
this country from London sometime ago to fill an engagement
as leading equestrienne in Forepaugh's
circus. As she appeared in the parlor in an interview
with a Philadelphia reporter, she might naturally have
been taken for the preceptress of some fashionable
English boarding-school, or the daughter of some
stiff old country squire of Kent or Sussex&mdash;or anybody,
in fact, rather than the daring rider whose performances
have bewildered and startled the circus-going
multitude of London, Paris, and Berlin. In feature
and manner her appearance was that of the English
gentlewoman, while her conversation throughout revealed
a delicacy of thought and expression common
only to the well-bred lady.</p>

  <div class="caption">CIRCUS RIDERS.</div></div>

<p>"The training necessary to success in equestrian
performances," continued Miss Deacon, "is monotonous
in the extreme and in some parts very dangerous.
None but those in rugged health ever withstand it, and
no one without a perfect physical organization should
undertake it. The ordinary exercises of the riding-school
are trifles as compared with the tasks imposed
in professional training. When a woman has obtained
all the knowledge to be acquired in a riding-school,
she has only got the rudiments of real equestrian art.
She must then enter the circus ring and familiarize
herself with the duties required of her there. She
must be prepared to endure falls and bruises without
number, together with frequent scoldings and corrections
from the instructors. No woman, unless she be
possessed of extraordinary natural skill, ought to appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>
in the ring before an audience until she has graduated
from a riding-school, and then practised in the
ring four or five hours every day for at least six months.
Those six months will be a period of torture and weariness
to her, but she must undergo them or run the risk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>
almost certain failure and humiliation upon her first
appearance in public.</p>

<p>"The best equestrian instructor in Europe&mdash;in fact
the only one of established reputation&mdash;is M. Salmonsky
of Berlin. He is one of the grandest horsemen
in the world, and in his great circus includes some
of the finest stock on the continent. He saw me first
in London, my native place, many years ago when I
was performing with my brothers and sisters in Henley's
Regent Street circus, and offered to take me with
him to Berlin and complete my training. I accepted,
and entered his circus at the German capital, where I
received the most careful instruction he could give
me.</p>

<p>"M. Salmonsky would send me into the ring with
his most spirited horses every day and stand by to
direct my exercises. Sometimes I thought I should
never survive the terrible discipline, and often thought
I should go back to London and content myself with being
a second-rate rider, but the kindness of my good old
instructor softened the innumerable bumps and bruises
I received, and I at last triumphed. Emperor William
and the crown prince attended the circus the night I
made my debut, and complimented me formally and
personally from their box.</p>

<p>"M. Salmonsky's course of training is very rigid,
and that accounts for its thoroughness. The pupil
must surrender wholly to the instructor and become
very much as a ball of wax in his hands. At the outset,
however, the scholar must obtain complete mastery
of her horses. Fear is a quality utterly hostile
to successful equestrianism, and unless the pupil can
banish it at the start, she had better give up her ambition
and abandon the profession. She will never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>
succeed so long as she is afraid either of herself or her
horses.</p>

<p>"But, as I said before, no one unacquainted with
the dangerous preparatory instruction of an equestrienne
has any proper estimate of the toil and weariness
which her performances represent. One never
knows the boundless capacity of the human frame for
pains and aches until one has gone into training for
circus-riding. What, with unruly horses, uncomfortable
saddles, and the violent exercise involved, five or
six hours of practice every day for months is certain
to do one of two things&mdash;it either kills the pupil or
brings her up to the perfection of physical womanhood.
The hours for practice adopted by M. Salmonsky were
in the forenoon&mdash;generally from eight to twelve,
with, perhaps, another hour or two in the evening.
To withstand this course one must dress loosely and
become a devotee to plain living and the laws of
hygiene. Any neglect of those principles, or any great
loss of sleep usually results in broken health and professional
failure.</p>

<p>"A great many persons who have the idea that the
life of a circus star is a happy one&mdash;that it is a round
of gorgeous tulle, tinsel, and ring-master-embellished
splendor&mdash;would be sadly shocked if they
could get a glimpse of the real thing. These people
are mistaken. It is really a life of hard work at pretty
much all hours of the day. When the splendid Mlle.
Peerless isn't speeding around the ring, lashing her
spirited bareback horse to fury, amid the plaudits
of admiring thousands, she is mending her tights,
stitching tinsel on her costume, anointing her bruises
with balsam, or practising. The practice of the circus
rider is like the rehearsal of the actor, only more so,
for while the actor has only to rehearse until his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>
performance and then can go on playing a part without
further trouble, the rider must put in an hour or two
every day to keep her joints limber and her muscles in
proper trim. But for this daily practice the performances
of our circuses would be the theatre of many a
tragedy instead of the scenes of mirth and gladness
that they are.</p>

<p>The fascination that the circus has for people who
know nothing about its hardships, is illustrated in the
case of a Georgia lady, who lived in luxury, and whose
husband was numbered among the most prominent of
the State's citizens. She became imbued with a desire
that she would like to sport tights and gauze
dresses, and whirl about the ring on a spirited horse,
so she struck up acquaintance with an equestrian, who
happened to come along with a fly-by-night show,
and eloped with him. The husband followed the
show to Texas some months afterwards, and had an
interview with his wife, who had became an equestrienne
in a small way, doing a pad-riding act in each performance.
An interview with the lady failed to make her
see her folly. The husband now grew desperate,
went away and hired a lot of cowboys whom he took
to the show with the understanding that as soon as
Mlle. Eulalia (the wife's adopted name) put in an appearance
they were to rush forward, and seizing her
carry her from the tent. When the lady appeared and
had been lifted upon the horse by the clown, and the ring-master
was touching up the heels of the animal to get
him into a funeral jog, the husband and cowboys advanced.
The husband seized his wife, dragged her
from the horse, and while the cowboys fought back
the performers and attaches he got her into a carriage
and drove her away, leaving the audience in the wildest
state of excitement. Kind words and gentle treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>
brought the woman back to her senses, and she is
now in her Georgia home and does not want any more
circus experience.</p>

<p>A Paris correspondent tells us that the funeral of
that charming circus rider, Emilie Loisset, who was
killed in April, 1882, was a Parisian event. The poor
girl had long inhabited the United States, and had the
freedom of manner and self-respect which so often distinguish
the American young lady. She was on horseback
one of the most graceful creatures imaginable.
The figure was lithe, but without meagerness. Her
poses in the saddle were simply exquisite, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>
appeared unstudied. The features were elegantly
formed, and the eyes expressed a brave, kind soul.
Emilio Loisset was more popular than Sarah Bernhardt
had ever been in Paris. Her less successful
rivals in the circus were brought by her exceeding
amiability to pardon her public triumphs. She did
not seem ever to excite jealousy. On the days and
nights on which she performed the circus was crowded
with fashionable people. There was no amount of
wealth that she might not have possessed had she not
been a proud, strong-willed, self-respecting girl. She
had no carriage and used to walk from the hippodrome
to the Rue Oberkampf, where she had a small lodging
on the fifth floor. A number of aristocratic and plutocratic
admirers used to escort her to the door,
through which none of them were allowed by her to
pass. She aspired to create for herself a happy home
and to marry somebody whom she could love and
esteem. Her sister, Clotilde, is the morganatic wife
of the Prince de Reuss, brother of the German ambassador
at Constantinople, and is looked up to in her
family circle. The admiration of the Empress Elizabeth
for Emilie was increased by the fact that the
charming circus rider spurned the address of the crown
prince of Austria.</p>

<p>He was very much in love with her when she was in
Germany, a couple of years ago, and would have forsworn
marriage if she would have consented to be his
Dubarry. She did not like the young man, and told
him so. The empress, when she was here, used to
make appointments to ride in the Bois with Emilie.
Her majesty thought the ecuyere charming to look at,
but wanting in firmness of hand. The horse on which
she rode with imperial Elizabeth in the shaded alleys
of the Bois was the one that occasioned her death by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>
rolling over on her and driving the crutch of the
saddle into her side. The august lady noticed the
hardness of the brute's mouth, and the teasing and at
the same time irresolute way in which Emilie held her
bridle.</p>

<p>Emilie Loisset aimed at classic purity of style.
There was nothing sensational in her manner. Her
imperial friend Elizabeth thought her the most ladylike
person she had seen in Paris. Her gestures were
simple, her address amiable, and there was seriousness
even in her smiles. Members of the Jockey
Club spoke to her hat in hand. Her death was
entirely due to the hard mouth of her horse. At a
rehearsal the horse turned round, made for the stable,
and, finding the door shut against him, reared up
on his hind legs. Balance was lost, the horse rolled
over, and the crutch of the saddle smashed in the
ribs upon the lungs and heart. Poor Emilie had the
courage in this state to walk to the infirmary, and
when she was taken home to mount five flights of
stairs.</p>

<span class="subhead">A ROMANCE OF THE RING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There is a great deal of romance in the life of a
circus performer; and as the theatrical world is often
penetrated in search of subjects rich in fiction, so,
too, romancers enter the circus ring to find a hero or
heroine for an o'er-true tale. In a Western paper I
found the following pretty and touching story, which
had evidently been copied from some other paper
without credit, and which, as it deals with circus life,
and particularly that feature of it we have just left&mdash;equestrianism&mdash;I
believe it will be found interesting,
and in reproducing it regret that I am unacquainted
with the source whence it came, as the publication in
which it originally appeared certainly deserves <span class="locked">mention:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The North American Consolidated Circus was to
show in Shadowville. Shadowville was named after
a legend of a haunted shadow that envelopes the town
after sunset; and long before the canvas flaps were
drawn back and the highly gilded ticket-wagon, with
the "electric ticket seller" was ready to change greenbacks
for the red-backed "open sesame," the ground
and two streets leading to the lot were crowded with an
anxious, expectant, peanut-munching, chewing-gum-masticating
collection. The large posters and handbills
announced in highly colored style the arrival of
"Miss Nannie Florenstein, the most wonderful bareback
rider in the known world!" while the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>
"gutter snipes" simply begged the people to "wait
for Miss Nannie Florenstein."</p>

<p>The "doors are thrown open," and in less than
twenty minutes the immense canvas is rising and
falling with the concentrated respirations of five thousand
people. Such a crowd! Charles Dickens, Anthony
Trollope, or Bret Harte would have been in
ecstacies at the curious collection of faces, costumes,
and vernacular, not to mention the expressions of
genuine enthusiasm or surprise at the entries into
the ring of even the sawdust rakers.</p>

<p>The band has ended its attempt at one of Strauss's
waltzes, and the master of ceremonies, Mr. Lunt,
walks consequentially into the ring, bowing to the
vast concourse, who applaud at&mdash;they scarce know
what.</p>

<p>"This way, Mr. Oliphant."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir! 'Ere hi ham. Ah, sir! this bevy
of smiling faces is refreshing even to the sawdust.
[Applause.] What shall we have now, sir?" asks
the jester (?) as he throws his hat in the air and
catches it on&mdash;the ground.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tom Karl."</p>

<p>"Not the tender singer, sir?"</p>

<p>"You mean tenor singer! No! The pad rider,
sir."</p>

<p>"It's all the same, Mr. Lunt; but time's flying.
Ah! here is Karl! Now, then, Mr. Karl, that's the
way I used to ride&mdash;(aside) in my mind."</p>

<p>And so it goes. One act after another, each one
showing agility, daring, and skill; while the old jester
and ring master entertain the crowd and rest the performers.</p>

<p>"Miss Nannie Florenstein, ladies and gentlemen,
will now have the honor of appearing before you in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span>
her wonderful bareback act&mdash;riding a wild, untamed
horse without either bridle, saddle or surcingle. An
act never before accomplished&mdash;although often attempted&mdash;by
any lady in the world! Miss Nannie
Florenstein!"</p>

<p>A lithe, pretty little lady, with an anxious, careworn
face, stepped into the ring, and, acknowledging
the applause of the audience, vaulted lightly on the
back of her black horse, and quicker than a flash
of lightning was off. Around and around the forty-two-foot
circle she goes, pirouetting, posturing, and
doing a really graceful and wonderful act.</p>

<p>She is what all the papers had claimed she would
be. There is a spirit of reckless daring flashing from
her dark eyes as she jumps "the banners," and even
the old and stoical ring master watches her anxiously
as she attempts one act more daring than the rest&mdash;that
of standing on her tip-toes on the horse's hindquarters
and slowly pirouetting as the animal continues
his mad career.</p>

<p>Suddenly she reels. She has lost her balance.
Over she goes. Her head has struck the ring board.
A shriek of a thousand anxious voices rends the air,
and all is confusion.</p>

<p>She is bleeding, bleeding profusely from a cut in her
forehead. A hundred hands are ready to convey her
to the dressing-tent.</p>

<p>A rough-hewn specimen of a man suddenly appears
in their midst. Where he came from or what moved
him no one knows.</p>

<p>"Stand back! stand back, I say, and give the gal
air! Do ye hear?"</p>

<p>Instinctively every one obeys him.</p>

<p>"Yere's a doctor. Doctor, this gal I know. 'Tend
ter her, an' look ter me for the perkisites."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
A quiet, confident-looking gentleman, Dr. Adams, is
already by her side, stopping the flow of blood, and
under his directions she is conveyed to her dressing-tent,
the miner, tall, athletic, and with immense, sunburned
beard, following anxiously in the rear.</p>

<p>The performance has been renewed and the crowd
are forgetting the accident, when the miner appears in
the ring dragging after him a performer, Monsieur La
Forge, as he is called, "the strongest man in the
world," who resists with all his might the iron muscles
that are clinched like a vice on his collar.</p>

<p>A trapeze act is being performed, but all eyes are
on the miner and his victim, not one of the performers
having interfered, as they all dislike and fear La Forge
for his bullying, bragadocio character.</p>

<p>"Leddies and gintlemin, this yere coyote am ther
cause on that yere young gal er falling. I knows 'em
both. He wanted ter kill her. Yes, yer did, ye
skunk! He stole her when she war a chile from my
sister. I knowed him; I knowed her. He hearn I
was coming ter-day and he sed that he'd kill her.
Lay down, yer he-bar! Lay down, I say.</p>

<p>"I was standing close on ter this ring when I seed
him fire sumthing at her. She turned her putty eyes
to see what it wur and over she went. Mister performers,
ye'll 'scuse me fur interruptin' yer performances,
but I thought I'd let these yere know who this
skunk is. Now, then, Meester Ler Forgey, alias John
Rafferty, what have yer got to say to my statement?"</p>

<p>"Hang him! Hang him! Strangle him!" broke
in the crowd as they left their seats and rushed for the
ring.</p>

<p>"Back! Back! Yer shan't hang him! Do yer
hear? Ther fust man that raises a finger to throttle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
him, I'll pile in that yere saw dust! Do yer
hear?"</p>

<p>His revolver levelled at the angry, grumbling crowd
held them back. They all knew him. All knew old
Ned Struthers, the most daring and best shot on the
frontier; a man whom the redskins feared more than
a whole army of trained United States soldiers; a
remnant of a race of men who could settle the Indian
question quicker, better, and with less expense than a
whole army of Indian whiskey-selling agents; a man
who they knew was dangerous and vindictive when
aroused. So all kept their distance.</p>

<p>"Now, thin, yer goll-darned skunk, git up off yer
knees! Git!"</p>

<p>"The doctor says Miss Florenstein is dying!" the
ring master, pale and breathless, announced as he ran
into the ring.</p>

<p>"Dying, did yer say, Mister? Oh, yer mean rattlesnake!
Pray she may live&mdash;pray! Ef she dies,
I'll hang yer scalp on her coffin! Do you hear?"</p>

<p>Poor Rafferty, by the intervention of the sheriff,
who had a free pass to the show, and was present, was
released from Ned Struthers's hold and taken away to
the lock-up while Ned hurried to the bedside of his
sister's child, Miss Nannie Florenstein.</p>

<p>She tossed and moaned upon her improvised bed
of straw, an anguish-stricken few around her; for
she was loved by the company. Her lustreless eyes
would open appealingly, and looking with tear-bedimmed
expression at some familiar face near her, try to
smile them a recognition&mdash;a sad, painful recognition.</p>

<p>The doctor knelt beside her with one hand on her
pulse and one on her bandaged forehead, and as he noticed
the weary, faint pulsation, would shake his head,
prophetic of her death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span>
The flaps of her tent are raised, and old Ned
Struthers, hat in hand, looks in, asking in a mute
way permission to enter. The doctor sees him and
beckons him to her side.</p>

<p>Nannie hears his footstep as it crushes the straw beneath
his weight, and, slowly opening her eyes, looks
at him in an indifferent, inquisitive way. Suddenly
they brighten; she closes them as if to think&mdash;in a
minute opens them with a glad smile of affectionate
recognition lighting up her handsome, pale face, raises
her weak hand, beckons him to her, and as he takes
her little fingers into his brawny palm she pulls him
gently to her and whispers something in his ear. She
cannot speak loud.</p>

<p>Old Ned cannot keep back the tears as they slowly
run down his bronzed cheek and are lost in the shadow
of his beard. He has now knelt beside her and answers
her whispered question.</p>

<p>"Yes, little un! I'm yer uncle&mdash;yer loving uncle!
Get well, little un, and I'll take care on yer." He
could say no more.</p>

<p>She, poor little bruised body, turns to him a grateful
smile of affection, and again drawing him to her,
kisses his wrinkled old forehead, while the group who
are silent witnesses of the scene turn away their heads
in silent sorrow.</p>

<p>"Say, Doctor, can't we move her to sum more kumfortable
quarters?&mdash;to ther hotel? Her aunty lives
some twenty miles from yere, and I'll send for her."</p>

<p>Again Nannie opened her eyes, looking anxiously at
the doctor, but a shadow darkened the tent opening
and a young, handsome-faced man enters; instantly
her eyes meet his, and she beckons him to her, and
drawing him down to her side, whispers a few words in
his ear. His face brightens, and turning to Ned&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>who
is curiously watching this last scene&mdash;puts out a
hard, muscular hand as he <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Mr. Struthers, Nannie tells me you are her uncle.
I am engaged to be married to Nan."</p>

<p>Old Ned eyed him curiously and doubtingly as he
<span class="locked">replies:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Wal, sir! what Nan tells yer is gospel truth. I'm
her uncle; but about the other part of the bizness I
ain't so sartin"&mdash;but seeing Nan's troubled face appealingly
turned to him, he continues: "But was she
right? Nan oughter be married. Ef she was she
wouldn't be yere, a jumping on bar horses' backs, he
showing her&mdash;I mean, sir, she oughter be at hum, and
I'd do thar barback ridin' for ther crowd&mdash;thet is, our
leetle crowd, ter hum; but 'scuse me, we must move
Nan&mdash;what's yer bizness, sir?"</p>

<p>"I'm in the same business as Nan; we were brought
up together, trained together, and next week we were
to be married."</p>

<p>"Together, I serpose?" laughingly answered Ned,
as he saw Nan brighten and smile at her intended's
words.</p>

<p>Nan was carefully removed to a hotel, the proprietor
of the circus defraying all the necessary expenses
of a large room and extra attendance. Old Ned was
about to start for his sister's, Nan's aunt, to attend
her, as the doctor had taken a more hopeful view of
her recovery if properly nursed, when he, entering the
bar-room of the hotel, preparatory to starting, was
suddenly made aware that he was the target of at least
a dozen eyes, all staring with a perplexed gaze at him.
First he thought it might be something in his dress,
but this he quickly ascertained was not so; then he
surveyed his face in the mirror opposite. At last he
got angry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
"What are ye all staring at? Do I owe enny on
yer ennything, eh?" He was defiant now.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Struthers, you don't owe anybody here
anything that I am aware of! We have congregated
here to congratulate you. We have heard you had recovered
your niece and your mine, and we come, as
fellow-townsmen, to congratulate you." It was the
town justice who spoke.</p>

<p>"My neese, pardner, I've diskivered, but ther mine
I wanter sell out to-morrow, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Struthers, here's a telegram for you." A
messenger boy handed him a telegram.</p>

<p>"Read that fir me, jidge, will yer?" And he
handed the telegram to the justice of the peace.</p>

<p>"Mr. Struthers, it is an offer from Col. Allston, of
San Francisco. He says: 'I will give you three hundred
thousand dollars and one quarter share for your
Red Gulch mine. Answer. Pay in cash.' That's
all, sir, only the news has been on the street for half
an hour!"</p>

<p>"Wal, I declare that's prime news! Let's take a
drink, boys. Squire, you jist answer that tillygram,
will yer? Tell Kurnel Allston I'll take the offer, and
he may send the cash yere. Say, boys, thet's gud
news, but I must tell my neese!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Struthers, before you go will you tell us about
your niece?"</p>

<p>"Sartlingly! Yer see boys, abeout fifteen years
agone my sister died an' left har leetle one&mdash;Nannie
was her name&mdash;left her with a widder woman in
'Fresco. I war away in Nevady; hed only been gone
three months. The young un war only nine y'ars old,
an' when I got thet news I war struck dumb. Yer see,
my sister hed heart disease. I started with my pack
mule fir 'Fresco, but whin I 'rived thar the young un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
and the widder war gone. I hearn she hed gone to
Brazzel with her husband, a man named Rafferty, a
sirkus performer, so I waited. Abeout thet time I
was takin sick with small-pox, and whin I got well I
could not get no news on thet young un, so I gave up
thar trial. Abeout one month ago I war at Red Gulch
Canyon, er staking off my 'find,' whin Jim Parkins,
my ole pard, wrote me from San Yosea thet my leetle

<p>The crowd&mdash;it was a crowd by the time he had

he escaped from them, hastening to Nannie's room to
find her wonderfully improved and able to sit up.</p>

<p>The circus left Shadowville without "Miss Nannie
Florenstein," and to-day she has returned from a
village church a blooming bride, "Frank Grace, the
celebrated bareback rider," being her happy husband.</p>

<p>Old Ned occupies a seat in their carriage.</p>

<p>"Uncle, you have made me a happy woman and
Frank a happy man."</p>

<p>"Yas, leetle un, I serpose so. It is better than
bar'-back riding, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle. But how can I thank you for all the

<span class="subhead">LEAPING AND TUMBLING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One of the great features of all travelling tent-shows
and, indeed, in the long years a very prominent feature
of the legitimate show when juggling, tumbling
and things of that kind were either interspersed
between the acts of a tragedy, or filled the intermission
between the tragedy and farce, was the acrobatic artist,
the athlete, the gymnast, or whatever else you may
feel like calling him. At the beginning of this century
there were several renowned acrobats, and the
number has increased to such an extent&mdash;and the general
desire for exhibitions of physical skill&mdash;that acrobatics
have taken possession of many fields. The song
and dance man aims to introduce as much as possible of
it into his act or sketch, and even the equestrian and
equestrienne attempts and succeeds in combining perilous
somersaulting with skilful riding, and the nearer
the performer goes towards breaking his neck the
better the people seem to like it.</p>

<p>The athlete who displayed his prowess or skill in
the arenas of ancient Rome or Athens was a much
more important personage than the circus performer
of to-day. It was the passionate love of manly sports
which produced the matchless Greek form, the acme
of physical perfection. The successful athlete, acrobat,
or charioteer of two thousand years ago was a popular
hero, and his triumphs, loves, and career were
immortalized in poetry and song. A successful athlete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span>
was then of more importance than the congressman
of to-day. And yet the modern athlete, while
occupying a much lower social scale than the ancient
practitioner, is just as strong, and the acrobat of
to-day is even more skilful than his classic predecessor.
The circus performer thinks nothing of executing
feats which no later than a century ago were
deemed impossible.</p>

<div id="ip_170" class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
  <img src="images/i_565.jpg" width="379" height="304" alt="" /></div>

<p>Nearly every man and boy who appears in the circus
arena now-a-days is counted a member of the corps
that does both grand and lofty tumbling. In small
shows the corps of leapers and tumblers is increased
by the addition of several dummies who can do little
more than turn a hand-spring or a forward somersault
either on the sawdust or from the spring-board. Many
of the best acrobats have begun their studies in the
open streets by walking on their hands or hammering
their heels against the bare bricks in somersaults or
hand-springs; others have been educated in the ring
following their fathers and sometimes grandfathers
into the arenic profession. From the ranks of these
two classes some of the best acrobats and athletes have
sprung. I can recall several very good leapers and
tumblers, whose earliest efforts were witnessed and
wondered at in some vacant lot or friendly stable
yard&mdash;where spring-boards were improvised and feats
as dangerous as "revolving twice in the air without
alighting on their feet"&mdash;as the ring master usually
announces this act, in his most grandiloquent style&mdash;were
attempted at the peril of young and frail necks.
So too with many horizontal bar and trapeze performers.
But to come back to the leapers and tumblers.
The band gives a flourish and in they troop for the
"ground act." They form in a row, and bow to the
audience and then away each one whirls in a hand-spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
and front somersault. Then they retire and
singly, the men begin to tumble backward and forward
across and about the ring, heads and feet are kept in
a whirl until the final effort is reached, when the clown,
who is frequently as good an artist in the business as
the rest of his tumbling confreres, chases the swiftest
of the number around the ring, the clown winding him
up while the latter rolls like a wheel, in back hand-springs
along the inner edge of the ring. A short interval,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>
and the leapers come in,&mdash;the same men as
those who have done the tumbling,&mdash;bow, and retire to
follow each other rapidly down an inclined plane, bound
from the spring-board, and after a forward somersault
land safely and gracefully in the soft mattress beyond.
One, two, three, four, and five horses are brought in
and placed in front of the spring-board while the mattress
is drawn farther away. As the number of horses
increases and the peril and distance grow greater, the
number of leapers decrease till at last three appear, or
perhaps more horses are added to the equine line, the
mattress is placed at the farther end of the ring and
the ring-master&mdash;sometimes it is a lecturer like Harry
Evarts, the "little Grant orator," of Coup's show for
the past and present season&mdash;mounts a pedestal near
the entrance, and with stentorian voice remarks:
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Batchellor, the champion
leaper of the world, will now throw a double somersault
over nineteen horses [sometimes fewer elephants
are employed]&mdash;that is to say, the gentleman will revolve
twice in the air before alighting on his feet on
the mattress&mdash;a feat that no other performer in this
or any other country can accomplish. Ladies and
gentlemen, Mr. Batchellor," and Mr. Batchellor, who
is an excellent leaper, and shares the championship
with Frank Gardner, formerly of Cole's show, but
now with Barnum, makes the leap in a clever and
comparatively easy manner.</p>

<p>This difficult feat, never executed, it is asserted, till
within the past one hundred years, can now be witnessed
at almost every first-class circus performance in
this country&mdash;but not always for the same distance
attained by Messrs. Batchellor and Gardner. Forty
years ago the British performer who could throw a
double somersault was looked on as a wonder. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
writer, some thirty-three years ago, saw Tomkinson, a
famous British clown and acrobat, execute this feat
in Franconi's circus, then stationed for the season at
Edinburg, Scotland. It was the same Franconi who
afterward managed the hippodrome in New York in
1863&ndash;4, and the company was booked as first-class in
every respect. The double somersault was performed
by Tomkinson at his benefit, and the announcement of
the then great feat packed the wooden building to suffocation.
When the ring-master had made the preliminary
speech, and Tomkinson retired up the steep
incline which terminated in the spring-board, every
heart stood still. A quick, impetuous rush down the
board, a bound high in the air, a slow revolution and the
gymnast descended nearly to the ground. It seemed
impossible to do it, but in the last six feet the curled
up body turned once more, and Tomkinson alighted
on the big, soft mattress on his feet, but staggering.
He was prevented from falling by the ring-master, and
as he turned to go inside, Franconi, the enthusiastic
French manager, patted him warmly on the back, amid
the applause of the vast audience. It was a rare feat
in those days. Tomkinson and the few other British
double somersault performers did it only at infrequent
intervals.</p>

<p>In this country Costella, a noted circus leaper, made
it more difficult by clearing a number of horses at the
same time. But soon a number of acrobats were able
to follow his example, and even excel him in height
and distance. Nowadays a circus acrobat who cannot
do a double somersault is not considered anything but
an ordinary performer unless he can do other sensational
and original feats. Last year Barnum had a
corps of acrobats, of whom seven performed double
somersaults every night during the season. John Robinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span>
has five men who can do it. The most surprising
and unexcelled feat of double somersault throwing was
that of the Garnella Brothers, who performed it in
variety halls and circuses a few years ago. Standing
on his brother's shoulders the younger Garnella sprang
up and revolved twice, landing again on the shoulders.
When it is considered that the double somersault by
other performers is accomplished by a short spurt, a
spring-board, and no restriction as to the spot of alighting,
the feat of young Garnella must be classed among
the unprecedented marvels of the acrobatic art.</p>

<p>The triple somersault is a dream of every young and
ambitious acrobat. It requires phenomenal dexterity
of body, and is known to be so dangerous that few
have even attempted it. Fame and fortune awaits any
performer who can do it, say twenty times in one
tenting season. Were it not that circus managers
know that the feat, or even the attempt, if repeated a
limited number of times, will certainly result in a
broken neck, they could well afford to pay the performer
$10,000 to $20,000 for a season; and were it not,
too, a proven fact, it would seem that the laws of
gravitation and the limitations of physical dexterity
forbade the turning of a triple somersault except by
accident. In turning a double somersault off a spring-board,
it is necessary to make a leap at an angle of
about thirty degrees to obtain the necessary "ballast"
or impetus to turn twice. If an almost perpendicular
leap is made, the leaper would not have leverage
enough to turn. In order to make the double somersault
the performer has to leap from the spring-board
with all his might to get the proper angle as well as to
attain a sufficient height, so that he may have time to
turn twice over before alighting. The same conditions
govern the triple somersault, only it is necessary to go
about one-third higher into the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>
An American named Turner accomplished a triple
somersault once in this country and again in England.
He tried it a third time and broke his neck. It is
claimed that with this exception and the exception of
Bob Stickney, of John Robinson's show, and Sam Reinhardt,
an ex-leaper, no acrobat has been successful.
The skeptic may say triple somersaults may be accomplished
by the aid of higher and more powerful spring-boards
than those in use, but that would merely change
the angle, and the result would be the same. Of
course the board could be placed high enough, but the
specific gravity of the performer's body would be increased
while descending. The height is not the only
trouble. If it was only height, such men as Stickney,
Batchellor, Gardner and one or two others, by improved
appliances and practice would overcome that difficulty.
But after the double somersault is accomplished
and the performer is ready to turn again, he "loses
his catch" or the control of his body, and is governed
in his descent by gravitation alone. His head being
heavier than his feet, he is very apt to light on it first
and break his neck.</p>

<p>The first recorded attempt to throw a triple somersault
in this country was made by a performer in Van
Amburgh's circus at Mobile, Alabama, in 1842. He
broke his neck. Another attempt was made in London,
England, in 1846. It was made in Astley's amphitheatre,
then leased to Howe &amp; Cushing, the American
managers. In this company was M.&nbsp;J. Lipman, a fine
vaulter, Levi J. North, now in Brooklyn, New York, a
famous equestrian; the late William O. Dale, a native
of Cincinnati, who died here, blind and broken down,
and who was an acrobat and equestrian of great
reputation, and Wm. J. Hobbes, a fine leaper. It
was previously announced that Hobbes would attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span>
a triple somersault, and the house was jammed. He
tried it, and was instantly killed. The next to try it
was John Amor, who was born under the roof of Dan
Rice's father's domicile, near Girard, Pennsylvania.
Amor travelled for years in this country with Dan Rice's
circus, and in that day was considered the greatest
gymnast in America, if not in the world. He is said
to be the first performer in America to turn a double
somersault over four horses. In 1859 he went to
England and travelled with a circus all through the
united kingdom. In the same year he attempted to
turn a triple somersault at the Isle of Wight, but
landed on his forehead and broke his neck.</p>

<p>Billy Dutton, it is said, performed the great feat
while a member of Lake's circus, at Elkhorn, Illinois,
in 1860, at a rehearsal, in the presence of John Lawton,
the famous clown, now with Robinson's circus.
Dutton was ambitious to have it to say he did it, and
did not make the attempt with the intention of repeating
it. He made the leap from a high spring-board.
Dutton said then he would not try it again, and that
his lighting upon his feet was an accident, as he could
not control his body after turning the second time.
Frank Starks, who was well known in Cincinnati, undertook
the feat at the fair grounds in Indianapolis in
1870, for a wager of $100. In the first attempt he
turned three times, but alighted in a sitting posture.
Every one was satisfied with the result, and the money
was tendered him. He proudly refused it, saying he
would repeat it, and light upon his feet before he felt
sufficiently justified in taking the $100. He did repeat
it, but struck on his head, dislocating his neck,
and death resulted a few hours afterward. Bob Stickney
accomplished the great feat when fourteen years of
age, while practising in a gymnasium on Fourteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>
Street, New York. William Stein, an attache of
Robinson's circus, was one of the persons who held
the blanket for him to alight upon. Stickney says he
believes he could do it again, but would not attempt it
for less than $10,000,
being fully convinced
that the chances for
his final exit from the
arena would be good
on that occasion.
Sam Reinhardt, a
former leaper, now a
saloon-keeper at Columbus,
when with
the Cooper &amp; Bailey
Circus at Toledo, in
1860, not being satisfied
with turning
double somersaults,
tried to add another
revolution. He
turned twice and a
half, alighting on the
broad of his back, and was disabled for a short period.
The fact that a triple somersault was ever accomplished
before a circus audience, after due announcement,
and under the same conditions as double somersaults
are performed&mdash;namely, landing on a mattress&mdash;may
be seriously doubted. The best informed circus
men say that it cannot be done with anything even
like comparative safety except in the sheets, a blanket
held by a number of men being used to catch the
alighting performer. It is claimed, also, that it has
never been accomplished except in that way.</p>

<span class="subhead">AN ADVENTURE WITH GIANTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>I was in the office of the old <i>Evening Post</i>, at St.
Louis one afternoon in 1879, when it was invaded by
Capt. M.&nbsp;Y. Bates and wife, the tallest married couple
in the world. They were travelling with Cole's circus,
and by invitation of the managing editor, who
wanted them interviewed, they visited the newspaper
office. A very small reporter had been assigned to do
the talking, and he waited patiently around the establishment
until a carriage drove up to the door and a
shout went up, "Here they come," at the sound of
which the interviewer hurriedly made for the waste-basket
which was under the table. Whether the giant
and giantess saw the diminutive reporter or not they
kept on coming in, and the scribe saw no other way
out of it than to dive into the ample recesses of the
basket, and nestle upon a bed of school-girl poetry,
statesmen's essays, and applications from last year's
and the coming year's college graduates, for managing
editorship. There is a barbaric sesquepedalianism
(which is a good long word to ring into a chapter about
six-storied people) and a prevailing atmosphere of
suffocation in such a waste-basket; nevertheless, the
tiny reporter crouched closer as the Brobdignaggian
people approached with a rabble that noised their heels
upon the floor, their tongues against the roofs of their
mouths, and that made things look and sound as if all
the quarreling powers of Europe had set their combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span>
forces down in the <i>Evening Post</i> office for the
special purpose of driving the senses of its whole staff
out through the top of the building. But all this was
seraphic bliss compared with the awful moment when
the giant captain deliberately sat down on the table
just over the waste-basket. It would take a million
horse-power jackscrew, I should think, to raise the fallen
hopes of the reporter just then. A man stands some
chance if a custom-house falls on him hurriedly, but
chance crushed to earth never rises again, when a giant
like this is threatening to make any easy-chair out of him.
I suppose nearly everybody has heard the funny story
about the fat woman and the living skeleton, in a New
York museum, who fell in love with each other. They
got along very nicely for a while, and were as affectionate
as if the two had pooled their issues of flesh,
blood, and bone, and divided up so that each tipped
the scale at two hundred and sixty pounds, instead of
the whale-like spouse tipping the scale at four hundred
and ninety, while the skeleton husband did not need
any more than a thirty-pound section of the beam to
balance his weight. They were as happy as the sweetest
of the singing birds until one day the husband allowed
his heart to stray off to the Circassian girl, who
had been originally born in Ireland, but had her hair
curled for a short side-show engagement. Mr. Skeleton
was making the weightiest kind of love to the fair
Circassian for probably a month before the fat woman
was made aware of the fact. Then the monster that
is usually represented as green-eyed, took possession
of her. She kept a careful vigil of all "Skin-and-bones'"
doings, as she called him, until one day she
found him during the noon hour, with his lean arms
around the Circassian girl's neck, and his thin lips
glued to her pouting labials of cherry-red. It is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span>
to describe the terrible manner in which she
swooped down upon Mr. Skeleton. It was enough to
say that she covered space with alarming rapidity, and
taking her thirty-pound husband by the back of the neck,
shook an Irish jig out of his rattling bones, after which
she threw him on the floor and deliberately sat upon him.
The vivacious showman who told this story said a millstone
could not have made a nicer sheet of wall-paper
out of the living skeleton, had one fallen on him, and
only for the buttons on his vest he could have been
pushed through the crack under the door, after the fat
woman got through with him. But to come back to
Capt. Bates, the table upon which he had seated himself
groaned, and the little reporter moaned. The
fleeting seconds were magnified into centuries, and the
man in the waste-basket afterwards told me that he
felt himself shrinking into something like a homœopathic
pill. The table, however, appeared to stand the
pressure a great deal better than the person under it,
and it was sometime before the latter came to reconcile
himself to the safety of his situation. When he
did so he peeped out.</p>

<p>The sight that met his gaze was a curious one.
There was the great towering giantess, of pleasing
features and with nothing of a "fee-fo-fum" air about
her, quietly seated in the editor's chair, taking in the
situation as if she had been accustomed to the thing
since Adam's father was bald-headed. And there
were the editors and news-hunters gazing on admiringly,
with one or two of them particularly awe-stricken
and wild-eyed. But the background was the thing.
It was a circus in itself. At the doors and windows,
upon tables and chairs, and perched further up on the
top of an inoffensive and weak partition, as high as the
giant himself, was a ghastly array of gaping mouths and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
bursting eyes in a setting of eager and dirty faces,&mdash;inside
and out, high and low, anywhere and everywhere
around the institution within seeing distance
were newsboys and boot-blacks till one couldn't rest;
with a dim and distant horizon of more respectable
visitors who had been tempted in by the unusual scene
and noise. After the usual courtesies had been interchanged,
the editor <span class="locked">remarked:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I had a young fellow assigned to interview you,
Captain, but I don't know where he is just now."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's gone to git an extension ladder,"
suggested a forward newsboy.</p>

<p>"No, Skinny," said another; "he told me he was
going to get old Stout's balloon."</p>

<p>At this moment there was a commotion under the
table. The giant's foot had swung back and collided
with the waste-basket. To say it was a big foot would
be like calling the pyramid of Cheops a brick-bat or
the Colossus of Rhodes an Italian plaster-cast. They
say Chicago girls have big feet; I don't know this to
be a fact, but if they have anything like the pedal
spread of Captain Bates they are entitled to the credit
generally given them of greatness in this way. At any
rate the collision between the foot and the basket
caused the recondite reporter to disclose his whereabouts.
The managing editor qualified his conduct as
unbecoming a newspaper man, and the giant himself
gently requested the scribe to come forward.</p>

<p>"You won't make a watch-charm out of me?"
queried the reporter, apprehensively.</p>

<p>"No, no," the giant answered, in an assuring tone.</p>

<p>"Nor a scarf-pin?"</p>

<p>The giant said he wouldn't.</p>

<p>This allayed the reporter's fears, and he came forward
from the atmosphere of "respectfully declined"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>
literature in which he had been. Capt. Bates's greeting
was most kind, and so was that of his wife. The
reporter saw at once there had been no necessity for
his previous timidity, and managing to get within a
couple of yards of the giant's ear, he excused his
awkward and silly actions. A pleasant chat followed,
in which the giant and giantess gave brief outlines
of their personal history.</p>

<p>Capt. Bates is now (1879) thirty-five years of age,
stands seven feet eleven and one-half inches in height,
and weighs about four hundred and eighty pounds. He
is well put together, handsome in features, genial in
speech, and has the reputation of being a sharp,
shrewd man of the world. Mrs. Bates is thirty-two
years old, of the same height as her husband, although
she really seems to be taller, and turns the scales at
about four hundred and twenty pounds. She is thinner
in form, but of excellent physique, is handsome,
and has the same frank and smiling expression on her
face as that constantly worn by her husband. She
says she likes the show business, because it brings
her in contact with so many persons. The Captain,
though, having been in it about twelve years, and
accumulated considerable means, does not care much
about parading his colossal proportions before the
public. It has been his desire of late years to live in
private, quietly on his farm in Ohio, where the couple
have a house built expressly for them, with doors, windows,
furniture, etc., on a giant scale; but until this
year they received so many handsome offers that they
forsook the sod for the sawdust, and the plow for the
platform. In 1880, I think it was, a giant child was
born to this enormous couple. The infant weighed
twenty-eight pounds at birth.</p>

<p>After listening patiently to the Captain and his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>
as they spoke of themselves, the little reporter whom
I have introduced the reader to already, suggested as
he nearly dislocated his neck in looking up at the lofty
couple, that it would have been a nice thing to be
around when they were making love to each other, but
Mrs. Bates said that was rather a delicate matter to
call up, and the reporter subsided. I could not help
thinking, however, that a fellow must feel awful queer
with four hundred and odd pounds of sweetheart upon
his knee. Himalayan hugging going on all the time,
and love-sighs that needed a Jacob's ladder to come
from the heart-depths playing above his head like
mountain zephyrs around the Pike's Peak signal service
station. And then when a fellow felt his love
away down in his boots, what an Atlantic cable job it
must have been to find out exactly where it was! And
the old garden gate, how it must have been like the
gates that brave Samson shouldered with probably a
little extra bracing to it. And what chewing-gum
swopping must have gone on, and ice cream eating,
perhaps a plate as large as a Northland <i>jokel</i> at a time,
and no two spoons in it, either? Oh, but it must have
been a heavenly thing!</p>

<p>"You weren't afraid of her big brother, Captain,
were you?" friendly interrogated the reporter.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; not at all," answered the Captain.</p>

<p>"If you sat down on him once you could have sold
him for a bundle of tissue paper, couldn't you?"</p>

<p>"That is not it, my boy," said the Captain. "She
didn't have any big brother."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I see."</p>

<p>Then the discourse turned into other channels, intended
to be of special interest to <i>splacmucks</i>&mdash;as
the Brobdignaggians called ordinary mortals&mdash;who
are contemplating marriage with giantesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>
"I suppose Mrs. Bates does not wield an ordinary
rolling-pin?" the reporter half queried, addressing
himself to Capt. Bates.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," the lady herself replied, laughingly.
"I have one made expressly for my own use, from
one of the largest of the Yosemite Valley trees."</p>

<p>"And you lay it on the old man now and then?"
the reporter asked.</p>

<p>"I can answer for that," put in the Captain. "She
sometimes brings it down so heavily on the rear elevation
of my skull that it feels as if I had run against a
pile-driver on a drunk or lost my way under the hammers
of a quartz mill."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bates certainly had the physical strength to
make a rolling-pin dance a lively jig in any direction,
and if the weapon is anything at all like what it is here
represented to be, Thor's celebrated hammer will have
to go to the hospital as a weak and debilitated concern
until the giants lay their domestic difficulties aside and
retire permanently from active service.</p>

<p>"It must be a gigantic thing when the Captain comes
home late at night, from the lodge, you know, falls
through the kitchen window into a pan of dishes, and
after stumbling up stairs goes to bed with his boots
on?" the reporter insinuated, as he looked sorrowfully
at the giantess.</p>

<p>"Oh, he never does that," said the lady; and after
a minute she added, "and he'd better not."</p>

<p>The giantess looked knowingly at the giant who looked
down at the floor. My thoughts wreathed themselves
fondly around the Yosemite-tree rolling-pin, and I guess
Capt. Bates's thoughts were turned in the same direction.</p>

<p>"Nobody ever dares to write <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">billet-doux</i> to Mrs.
Bates," said the reporter. "I suppose you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span>
circus and theatrical people are subject to that sort of
thing."</p>

<p>"Not any body that I know of," the Captain answered.</p>

<p>"And I suppose if anybody did they wouldn't care
about having you
know it, either?" said
the little <i>Evening
Post</i> man.</p>

<div id="ip_172" class="figright" style="width: 191px;">

<p>The Captain made
no reply, but a mysterious
kind of look
crowded into his
eyes, and if anybody
around the newspaper
office had dared
to entertain a spark
of affection for the
giantess he could see
at once that he didn't
stand the ghost of a
show while the giant
was around.</p>

<p>"Now, Captain,"
the tiny and timid
reporter remarked,
moving to a distance,
"I know you like
travelling, and I have
one more question I
would like to ask
you. It is about hotel
accommodations.
Don't you occasionally have to hang your head or feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>
over the ends of the beds you encounter?"</p>

<p>This question disgusted the Captain and he rose
from the table indignantly, as did Mrs. Bates from the
editorial chair, and doubling themselves up as they
reached the doorway
they majestically
swept out of the
newspaper office, and
stepping into their
carriage were driven
away.</p>

<p>Another notable
giant is Colonel
Routh Goshan, who
was born in the city
of Jerusalem, on the
5th day of May, '37,
of Arabian parents.
He is the youngest
of a family of 15
children, who like
himself, father and
mother were all giants.
He served
with distinction in
the Crimean war,
and afterwards in the
Mexican army.</p>

<p>Colonel Goshen
stands 7 feet 11 inches
in his stocking
feet, and measures
75 inches around the chest, 25 inches around the arm,
and wears a No. 11 shoe. His weight is 666 pounds.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE "TATTOOED TWINS."</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Wanted</span>&mdash;The address of some one who can tattoo with Indian ink on the
person. A.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;H., No. &mdash;, &mdash;th Street.</p></blockquote>

<p>This advertisement appeared in a St. Louis Sunday
morning paper. The number and the street are not
given for reasons that will at once present themselves to
every intelligent reader. Now there is sometimes that
in an advertisement which attracts one like a pretty girl.
A few lines may furnish a neat little intellectual flirtation,
and very frequently can, like a coy and pretty
maiden, keep coaxing a fellow along until he is perfectly
lost in the maze of an affection that he has
neither the tact nor the willingness to try to escape
from. As soon as my eyes lit upon them and the
words from the capital W in the beginning to the period
at the end were taken in, I was irrevocably gone
on them. Like the immortal J.&nbsp;N., I immediately
lifted the veil and looked at the suppositious sanctuary
behind it, and then saw that walking art gallery, Capt.
Costentenus&mdash;known to thousands of people who saw
him travelling as the tattooed man&mdash;lying bound hand
and foot upon the earth and surrounded by half a dozen
Chinese Tartars, who were industriously pricking him
with pointed instruments, which were ever and anon
dipped into the little basins of blackish-blue liquid.
The scene changed suddenly into a room at No. &mdash;,
&mdash;th Street, and the Tartars were metamorphosed
into a single individual of a decidedly Caucasian aspect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span>
but with features wrought in that indistinctness which
very frequently is characteristic of the shapes and
forms seen in waking dreams, and the Greek Captain
was replaced by an equally Caucasian subject, who was
quietly undergoing the operations of having his breast
tattooed in the most lavish and picturesque manner that
the artist knew how. This idea fastened itself in my
mind to such an extraordinary extent that merely for
the purpose of gratifying a certain instinctive curiosity,
as well as to see if my suppositions were correct,
I called at the house indicated next afternoon.</p>

<p>It was a large three-story boarding-house in a very
quiet part of the city, and situated romantically
enough to lend the coloring of fact to the picture I
had previously conjured up of the surroundings of the
gentleman who wanted to be tattooed.</p>

<p>A young girl opened the door, who knew nothing of
the person who owned the initials that appeared in the
advertisement. I explained that this was the number
and street&mdash;it was certainly the right house&mdash;and
couldn't she recollect some name that began with an
H. No, she could not. She did not think there was
any gentleman boarding in the house whose name began
with an H, and then she recollected that there
had come to the house a few days before a man whose
name she did not know. She would call her mother.
"Ma! oh, ma!" rang down through the hallway,
and around behind the staircase, and down into the
dining-room, and up came the assuring response,
"I'll be there in a minute." Enter the landlady with
a wet towel on her head, and wiping her fingers on the
corner of her apron. In answer to the daughter's query
as to what the "new gentleman's" name was, she replied,
as if she had known him since the corner-stone
of Cheops was laid, that he was Mr. Henneberry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>
Was he in? No, not just then, but he would be back
in time for dinner, which would be spread in about half
an hour. Somewhat disappointed I replied that I
would take a walk around and call at the end of the
half hour, and was about to leave the door when a
voice was heard on the upper landing, and the words
"Hold on!" shouted in a very peremptory manner
brought me to a halt. It was Mr. Henneberry, as I
soon ascertained, when a tall, stout, well-proportioned
gentleman, of handsome features and the prettiest
black hair my eyes ever gazed upon, came down, introduced
himself, and invited me in. The object of
the visit was explained in a few words.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Henneberry, "I've been just
talking to a gentleman up in my room, an old sailor,
who was crippled some years ago, by falling from the
spar of a South American sailer, so he says, and who
appears to be pretty expert. I rather like the man,
and I think he will about suit me. He needs money,
what you don't appear to do, and I think he is just the
very man for what I want. So you see, I think you're
a little late."</p>

<p>I expressed my regret at not having seen the advertisement
earlier.</p>

<p>"You see," continued Mr. Henneberry, "I want
somebody who will stay in the house here, and be
available at all times during the day. It's a pretty
long job&mdash;" and here he checked himself. "No, I
don't mean a long job, because there ain't much of it,
but what there is has got to be done neat and right up
to the handle. What sort of work can you do?"</p>

<p>I bared my arm and exhibited a large death-head
and cross-bones, an American eagle, and a bust of
George Washington, which I had tattooed into me,
when young and fond and foolish, by a Greek sailor I
met in Milwaukee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a></span>
"That's pretty good," said Henneberry. "Where
did you learn the business&mdash;if I might call it a business?"</p>

<p>Here I explained that an old sail-maker had taught
me the art and that, having acquired the modus operandi
of pricking the color into the flesh, I was perfectly
at home in the business, as I was also an experienced
sketcher.</p>

<p>Further talk followed, in which Mr. Henneberry
spoke of tattooing generally, but made no allusion to
the person to be tattooed nor the extent of the work to
be done. At last, as he rose from his chair, as a gentle
reminder that he had said about all he wanted to say,
remarked that I might call again, as he had yet made
no definite arrangement with the man up-stairs and
probably would need two.</p>

<p>I went off chagrined, and wished that the old salt
with the broken leg, who had gotten in ahead of me
had broken his neck when he fell from the spar of that
South American sailer. I left the door whistling, "We
Parted by the River Side."</p>

<p>A saunter into a shady spot at a safe distance from
the house, and a mind made up to await the outcoming
of the successful rival, were the results of a sudden
inspiration. An hour passed, a half more, three
quarters, and it was just about an even couple of hours
when out from the door of No. &mdash;, &mdash;th Street, limped
a middle-aged, bent man, and he came directly towards
me. He passed me by, for about half a block, when I
caught up, and introduced the opening wedge of conversation
by remarking that the weather was a little
cooler than folks around there had been used to for the
past month or so.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," was the reply, "but I don't mind it
so much. You see I've hove to in hotter ports than
this'll ever be. That sunstroke period was Injun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a></span>
summer compared with the brimstun climate I've
pulled through. I've been along the African coast
when it was hot enough to make a mill-stun sweat. If
they could have just shipped that weather North it
would thaw the North Pole into hot water inside of fifteen
minutes."</p>

<p>And then the crippled sailor told of other experiences
in other warm climates, and we talked on in
an easy, friendly way for three or four blocks, when
my companion remarked that he was going to take the
cars. I said I was going to do the same, and as soon
as we were seated on the shady side of the conveyance
I remarked in a careless, off-hand <span class="locked">way:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"You got ahead of me in that job down at Henneberry's,
old man."</p>

<p>He opened his eyes, looked at me half suspiciously,
and said: "Then you're the young man the gentleman
was talking about to me. You went to see him,
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>An affirmative was the answer.</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't be so put out. He ain't engaged
nobody yet. At least he ain't closed with me.
You see, he's a bit scary. Didn't he tell you what he
wanted?"</p>

<p>"Yes. At least, he left me to infer that he wanted
either himself or somebody else tattooed."</p>

<p>"All over?"</p>

<p>"I thought that was what he meant."</p>

<p>"Well, blast his jib! He made me make all sorts
o' promises not to open my port-hole about it."</p>

<p>"It is a very funny project, isn't it?" asked the reporter.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not at all. I've been at it afore. I
worked at a man up in Canada for about three months
and got him nigh half done, when he died."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span>
"It's a pretty dangerous operation, this tattooing?"
was the next gentle insinuation.</p>

<p>"Yes, sometimes. But Henneberry can stand it.
He looks as if he had the constitution and he appears
to be reckless of the consequences. He wants to be a
show-fellow. He's struck on it, just the same as that
Canada chap who kicked. He's got an idea that
there's money in it, and he's always talkin' about that
Grecian chap as is with the circuses, you know."</p>

<p>"How long will it take to do the job?"</p>

<p>"Well, that I don't exactly know. He talks of
havin' two of us at it. Maybe you're the other fellow,
and he's in a stormy hurry about havin' it finished up,
and wants a fellow to stay in the house with him all
the time so that he can take his tattooing just when he
feels like it. Are you good in drawin' dragoons, flyin'
fish, elephants, boey constrictors and sich, young
man?"</p>

<p>I replied that I was an adept in delineating animals
of the sort named.</p>

<p>"Then I guess he'll want you. I used to be a
pretty good drawer myself afore I fell from that South
American, but my hand shakes no little now; but you
just lay the lines, and if I don't stick 'em in as clean
as a copper plate, my name ain't Jack Hogan."</p>

<p>"What will he pay for the job?"</p>

<p>"Well, I asked $600 calc'latin' six months would
do it, but he brought me down to $450 and will pay
my board and lodgin'. That ain't bad."</p>

<p>The reporter coincided with Jack Hogan that it
appeared to be a pretty good thing.</p>

<p>"And you don't git your money down either. He
wants to be fixed up from the soles of his feet to near his
shirt collar and wristbands, in the house where he is
now, and then he's goin' off to some quiet spot and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a></span>
have his face and hands and even his ears and the top
of his head, for he's partly bald, done up in some place
in the country, or may be out in some of the Pacific
islands, and if it's a bargain between us I'll have to go
with him."</p>

<p>"What catches me," said I, as we got up to leave
the car, "is what Henneberry will do with himself when
the finishing touches are all put on him."</p>

<p>"I can't say, but I s'pose he'll go off to the Sandwich
Islands, marry a nigger squaw, or something of
that sort, and come back with a cock-and-bull story
about being captured by savages, and then swing
'round the circle with some circus or other. He's got
the money to push the thing through, and I believe he
can stand it. Maybe he'll travel with old Cos'tenus,
and they'll call themselves the tattooed twins."</p>

<p>And the old fellow laughed heartily as he got down
carefully from the platform of the car, and limped
away towards the river&mdash;perhaps down to the Bethel
Home on the levee.</p>

<p>The foregoing story may be regarded as quite a valuable
clue when associated with a piece of information
furnished by an Albany, New York, journal, whose reporter
says the work on Capt. Costentenus's body pales
when compared with that shown by a young man who
stopped over in Albany one evening last summer on
his way from Saratoga to his home in Syracuse. His
name is Henry Frumell, and he is but twenty-three
years of age. Although so young, he has, according
to his own story, seen considerable of life. In 1876
he ran away from home, shipped on a merchant vessel
which was trading among the Washington Islands in
South Pacific. While there he underwent the tattooing
process, which he described as the most painful
torture ever endured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a></span>
"How was it done, and by whom?" he was asked
by a reporter.</p>

<p>"By the natives, and with six needles fastened to a
stick. Do you see them (showing the backs of his
hands and wrists)? There is a lady's face on one and
a man's on the other. Vermilion red and indigo blue
were used, being pricked in with the needles. Now you
see that the work is executed just as neatly and perfectly
as it could possibly be on the human skin.
Well, it took weeks before the design was finished,
and it had to be pricked over a number of times."</p>

<p>"It must have been painful."</p>

<p>"It was. But then I had no choice but to submit."</p>

<p>"Why, were you compelled to undergo the tattooing?"</p>

<p>"Hardly that, but it was wiser to do so."</p>

<p>"How could natives execute the work so perfectly?"</p>

<p>"They used designs given them by a sailor named
John Wells, who belonged to an English vessel.
Those on my wrist are not so perfect as on other portions
of my body."</p>

<p>"Did they tattoo you all over?"</p>

<p>"All except a small portion of the left leg above the
ankle."</p>

<p>The designs so ineffaceably worked into Frumell's
skin are numerous and beautiful, and some of them so
appropriate to the young man's nationality that it is
difficult to imagine how a South Pacific savage, even
with an English sailor for an advisor, should have selected
such fitting pictures. On his back, extending
from shoulder to shoulder, and from the nape of the
neck downward was a spirited illustration of two ships
in action. Below it is a snake with protruding fangs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">589</a></span>
and a scroll with Paul Jones's motto, "Don't tread on
me." On his breast is the national coat of arms
worked on the breast of an American eagle with
pinions outspread, and the national colors in its beak.
This covers the entire breast from armpit to armpit,
and from the throat downward. Both arms are literally
covered with designs of beasts, birds, and flowers.
The lower limbs are also ornamented, one with the
"Crucifixion of Christ" and the other with the shamrock,
harp of Erin, and other designs. Each kneecap
looks like a full-blown rose, with its vivid coloring
and almost perfect imitation of that flower. The remainder
of his body is similarly decorated, over five
months being occupied in the process, and considerable
more time being occupied in healing. His skin
has the feeling of the finest velvet, and he says that he
does not experience any evil effects from the immense
quantity of poisonous dye injected into the cuticle.
He has tried to eradicate the designs on his hands by
burning, but without avail.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_XLV" id="CHAPTER_XLV"></a>CHAPTER XLV.<br />

<span class="subhead">IN THE MENAGERIE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Before entering the menagerie let us look at the
huge cannon standing here outside the dressing-tent.
It looks like a ponderous affair, but investigation shows
that it is made of wood. There is a latitudinal slit
at the lower end and a lever. It requires an effort to
push the lever back which indicates that there is a
pretty strong spring in the bottom of the cannon.
This is the piece of ordnance that Zazel is shot out of
into a net some distance away. She lies on her back in
the cannon, which is tilted to an angle of about forty-five
degrees, assumes a rigid position, and at the word
fire the lever is pulled back, the spring released, a
pistol is fired, and while Zazel is coming through the
air a little cloud of smoke rolls from the cannon's
mouth and is swept away almost before she lands on
her back in the net. Sig. Farini says Zazel is his
daughter. Barnum says that when he was in London
where Zazel was doing the cannon act, creating a
great furore, the pretty little French girl came to him
crying and asked to be taken away. She was only
getting about six dollars a week for the perilous work
she was doing and Farini was drawing a large salary
out of which she got this pittance.</p>

<p>Sig. Farini also owns the Zulus that have appeared
here. As their manager he is well paid for them, and
as the Zulus sleep in the menagerie tent and have but
few wants and he gives them about a dollar a day&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">591</a></span>so
Barnum says&mdash;Cetawayo's subjects are a profitable
investment for him. Zulu Charley on exhibition in
New York gets the magnificent sum of one dollar a day
for doing his native war-dance and standing fire under
the numerous eyes that are leveled at him daily.
There is a bit of romance about this black warrior.
Among the crowds who thronged to see the antics of
the Zulus at Bunnell's Dime Museum, New York City,
last winter, was an Italian girl named Anita G. Corsini,
eighteen years old, a music teacher by occupation, and
the daughter of a Mr. Corsini who is in business in
New York. Zulu Charley won her admiration and
love, and she spent many quarters from her hard-earned
savings to see the dusky object of her affections.
Charlie did not repel her affections and they swore to
be true to each other. Mr. Corsini, however, did not
regard with favor the prospect of a marriage between
his daughter and a negro, and did everything in his
power to dissuade her from carrying out her intention.
Last week, however, the couple eloped, but
while on their way to a minister's house they were arrested
at the instance of Anita's father.</p>

<p>When the case came up on the following morning in
the Jefferson Market court the father wanted to have
the girl sent to Blackwell's Island, but upon her
promise to obey him and leave the Zulu he changed
his mind and took her home. But she again met
Charley and, accompanied by another Zulu named
Usikali, and Charles Richards, a white man, they went
to the residence of the Rev. R.&nbsp;O. Page, Brooklyn,
and asked to be married. The minister consented,
but he seems to have made a mistake, addressing
all the questions to Usikali instead of to Charley,
and then pronounced them man and wife. On learning
his mistake, however, he performed another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">592</a></span>
ceremony between the right parties. The newly married
couple then went to the museum, where the
bridegroom took part in the usual Zulu war-dance.</p>

<p>The tattooed Greek Costentenus with his picture-covered
flesh is always an object of admiration to the
ladies. He says he was tattooed into his present
shape by Chinese Tartars and tells a harrowing story
of his sufferings.</p>

<p>The torturing doesn't seem to have impaired his
health or bothered his appetite any. He is a magnificent
looking man physically and in his unstripped condition
is a figure that the eye of an artist would delight
to dwell upon. His only rival is a lady who
is now on exhibition in England and whose breast
and upper and lower limbs are covered with tattooing.
I do not know her history, but she probably
submitted to the process to make money out of
it. Dr. Lacassagne, a French physician, has published
a book on the habit of tattooing as
practised in the French army. There are professional
tattooers in Paris and Lyons who charge half a
franc for each design. Generally the tattooer has cartoons
on paper and reproduces these on the skin by a
mechanical process. Large designs cost a good deal;
a big representation of an Indian holding up the flag
of the United States costs the decorated person fifteen
francs. China ink is the coloring substance preferred,
touched up with vermilion. Dr. Lacassagne
has collected one thousand three hundred and thirty-three
designs, tattooed on three hundred and seventy-eight
members of the Second African Battalion or on men
under arrest in military prisons. Many were tattooed
on every part of the body except the inner side of the
thighs. Patriotic and religious designs and inscriptions
amounted to ninety-one. There were two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">593</a></span>
and eighty amorous and erotic devices and three
hundred and forty-four works of pure fantasy, such
as ladies driving in a carriage, the horses plunging and
servants rushing to their heads. The great efforts of
art are reserved for the surfaces of the breast and
back. The subjects of many of the drawings are best
left undescribed, the imagination of a dissipated soldier
being quite savage in its purity. Among patriotic
and religious emblems are cited two devils, nine
theological virtues, six crucifixes, two sisters of charity,
three heads of Prussians, not flattered, and five
portraits of ideal girls of Alsace, with no fewer than
thirty-four busts of the republic. Among animals the
lion and the serpent are the favorite totems. Among
flowers the pansy is generally preferred. The æsthetic
classes will be grieved to hear that not a single lily appears,
and there was only one daisy. Among mythological
subjects the sirens are the greatest favorites;
next comes Bacchus with his pards, Venus, Apollo and
Cupid.</p>

<p>Gen. Tom Thumb and his agreeable little wife are
once more swinging around the sawdust circle with
their old friend Barnum. Gen. Thumb is the most
successful dwarf the world has ever seen. He is rich
and as happy as if he and his wife were as tall as
Captain and Mrs. Bates, the giant and giantess whose
immense forms loom up above the crowds that throng
the menagerie tent. I have written elsewhere about
captain and his wife.</p>

<p>"Tummy T'um is ze worst bluff at pokair I ever
saw," said Campanini one day, in a confidential mood;
"I ride wiz heem in sefenty-seex from Pittsburg to
Veeling, and he loose me elefen dollars on a pair of
deuces. Ze Generale is a bad man at ze national
game."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">594</a></span>
Campanini, it is well known, is exceedingly economical,
and the loss of eleven dollars he gulped down as
well as he could, sinking it away below the region of
his lower register. It was a misfortune he will never
be able to forget entirely, but General Thomas Thumb
is a perfect basilisk to the distinguished tenor. Whenever
their shows exhibit in the same town the singer
looks up the dwarf and challenges him to a game of
chance. They last met in St. Louis, a short time
before Campanini's departure for Europe, and oddly
enough they settled on a game of billiards, although
probably for prudential reasons on Campanini's
part, as it was impossible for Tom Thumb to win such
a disastrous sum as eleven dollars from the Italian at
that manly game.</p>

<p>The game took place in the principal billiard-room of
St. Louis, and it was rendered doubly interesting by the
fact that Charles Mapleson, faultlessly attired, kept
the talley. A great crowd was soon attracted into the
room, and the only regret of the two distinguished
players was that they had not charged a general
admission, reserved seats extra.</p>

<p>As the game proceeded Campanini grew excited, and
the sonorous notes of his full, rich voice resounded
through the corridors of the great hotel. This, in
turn, irritated the General, and his weak, piping tones,
with a tinge of anger in them, contrasted strangely
with the Italian's. The crowd laughed, and Campanini
unconsciously exhibited some of the richest
treasures of his stock-in-trade, while the General grew
desperate and absolutely tried to reach across the
table.</p>

<p>"Fefteen," shouted Campanini.</p>

<p>Failing in his first effort, the General again tried to
accomplish the impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">595</a></span>
"Fefteen," Campanini shouted once more.</p>

<p>Just then Charles stepped forward and offered to
lift up little Hop-o' My Thumb.</p>

<p>"Who is playing this game, anyhow?" the General
fiercely demanded.</p>

<p>"Fefteen," again shouted Campanini.</p>

<p>"That makes three times the bloody Italian has
said 'fefteen,'" Thumb remarked, regaining his lost
temper, and then to Campanini's dismay he proceeded
leisurely to win the game.</p>

<p>"Elefen dollars at pokair, twenty-five cents at billiards&mdash;elefen
twenty-five," the tenor kept muttering
during the rest of the day, and that night at the opera
Col. Mapleson could not understand why Campanini
was so hoarse.</p>

<p>The "Wild Ape of Borneo" seems to be quite an
intelligent animal and displays first-rate taste in choosing
his company. He has learned by experience that
girls were made to be hugged and kissed. Through
the bars of his cage he has seen many a rural lass's
waist in the power of a plough-boy's arm, and watched
their lips meet in a smack that more than discounted
the old minstrel joke about the sound resembling the
noise made by a cow pulling her hoof out of the mud.
It was no wonder, then, that when the "wild ape" got
out of his cage, while the circus was exhibiting down
South, he forgot all his Borneo breeding, and made a
rush for one of the prettiest girls under the flapping
canvas. He got one arm around her neck and with
the paw that was free caught her chignon and made a
desperate effort to obtain a kiss. The girl's escort
was at first terrified and felt like climbing one of the
quarter-poles, all the females in the neighborhood
shrieked, and the males began to dive under their
seats. At last a gentleman rushed up with drawn revolver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">596</a></span>
and fired a shot close to the ape's ear, whereupon
he at once abandoned his osculatory efforts, and
made his escape.</p>

<p>A curiosity that has been before the public for
almost twenty years is the "two-headed woman,"
Millie Christine. The fact of the matter is that there
are two women joined together below the waist, but as
they have a single physical organization their manager
has seen fit to call them one. This freak of nature is
more astonishing than were the Siamese twins or the
Hungarian sisters. The two-headed woman was born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">597</a></span>
of slave parents on the plantation of Alexander McCoy
near the town of Whiteville, Columbus County, North
Carolina, on July 11, 1851. Prior to this Millie
Christine's mother had given birth to five boys and
two girls, all of ordinary size and without deformity.
The "two-headed woman" will be best understood
by reading an extract from a lecture by Prof. Pancoast
of the Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia.
The Professor examined this curiosity and discussed
upon the subject before a large gathering of medical
men. In introducing Millie and Christine, he said he
considered them the most interesting monstrosity of
their class that has ever come under the notice of
scientific men, far more interesting than the Siamese
twins. In the midst of his discourse the young ladies
entered, clad in green silk on their two bodies, pretty
little bronze boots on their four feet, white kids on
their four hands. They moved forward like an expanded
V, with a crab-like movement that was not
ungraceful. Born back-to-back; the Professor explained
that the natural desire of each to walk face
forward had twisted them in their present position.
Separate entities, separate individualities, each can
pursue separate lines of thought and conversation independent
of the other. From habit their appetites call
for food and drink at the same time. All the ills of
flesh are not, however, necessarily theirs in common.
One may have the toothache and the other be free
from any ache. But in the examination conducted to-day
the Professor discovered a remarkable development
of sensibility since his previous examination, eight years
ago. Touching them on any extreme of the body, on any
foot, for example, both in common were conscious of
the touch. Christine has been and is now the larger
and stronger of the two. As children they used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">598</a></span>
have little struggles and quarrels for supremacy, but,
as they could not get away from each other, they early
concluded that the best way to get along in their novel
path through life was to yield to each other. Their
present happiness and affection for each other is an
example for couples who are yoked together in marital
bonds. Sometimes Christine rolls over Millie in bed
without awakening her. Both can sleep separately.
They can stand and walk on their outside legs, but
they prefer to walk on all fours. Millie cannot lift up
Christine's legs, or Christine Millie's legs. Since the
Hungarian sisters, there has been no similar case reported
reaching adult life for one hundred and seventy
years. The bond of union between these, which is
just above the bones of the spine, is chiefly cartilaginous,
but the spines are so closely approximated that
there is an osseous union between them. To the question
by Professor Pancoast, whether either was engaged
to be married, each denied the soft impeachment with
decision, though the Professor explained that physically
there are no serious objections to the marriage
of Her or Them; but morally there was a most decided
one. During the Professor's lecture the Misses
Christine Millie and Millie Christine appeared very
much interested in the diagnosis of their singular condition
and evidenced their superior intelligence by
their apt and ready answers.</p>

<p>Turning from the human to the zoological branch of
the exhibition, we find the usual assortment of animals
from the monkey up to Jumbo, the elephant, who is only
one of a dozen in the possession of his owner. All performing
elephants are well trained, and there is scarcely
one that cannot figure in the ring, responding to the
good advice of the trainer, as the keepers often style
themselves. The monkeys are always a source of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">599</a></span>
amusement, and never loose their drawing power.
They are intelligent animals, but the inclination they
have for mischief makes them quite dangerous. They
tell a funny story about an actor out West who had a
pet monkey that he carried with him wherever he
went, even to the theatre. Jocko appeared to be perfectly
harmless, and as he had been at the theatre
night after night without making trouble, his master
never dreamed that he would do anything out of the
way. Imagine his surprise therefore when one night
as he was in the midst of a comedy part down came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">600</a></span>
Jocko from the "flies" with a false face he had filched
out of the property-room. His appearance brought
down the house and the play was spoiled.</p>

<p>A traveller in Japan writing about the amusements
there tells us of a very remarkable Sigmian specimen.
He says: "There is an unpretentious show, costing
one cent to witness, that is full of interest to those
who have leanings toward Darwin's theory of the
origin of mankind. It has a trained monkey of no
mean attainments. The creature stands upright about
three feet high, a well-developed and intellectual-looking
monkey, which will go through all the posturing
known to the famous India-rubber man, and some
that that famous individual could not throw himself
into, but the crowning feat that he has been taught is
to dance the Japanese dance to perfection, taking the
exact step, having the correct sway of the body, keeping
time faultlessly, and using his arms and hands in
exact accord with the movements of the feet. It is
difficult to realize that a dumb brute can be educated
as completely as this creature is. Oscar Wilde and
this monkey would make a strong partnership in the
platform business, for the monkey is certainly an
æsthete&mdash;"a darling and a daisy."</p>

<p>If any reader wants to buy a menagerie he can obtain
his curiosities from dealers in New York or Europe.
He must have plenty of money though, as the prices
of animals range high, as will be seen in the following
figures: An elephant may be had for $16,000; lion
and lioness with cage, $9,000; sea cow, $8,000; pair
of large leopards and two smaller ditto, $5,000; Australian
kangaroo, $2,000; Australian wombat, $12,000;
ostrich, $1,000; royal tiger, $5,000; sacred camel,
$2,000; rare birds, monkeys and lesser animals, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">601</a></span>
those of American nativity, $20,000; total,
$60,000.</p>

<p>Among the rarest animals, says a writer on this subject,
are the hippopotamus and the gnu, or horned-horse.
A first-class hippopotamus is worth five or six
thousand dollars, an elephant from three to six thousand
dollars, a giraffe is worth about three thousand
dollars, a Bengal tiger or tigress will bring two thousand
dollars, leopards vary from six to nine hundred
dollars, a hyena is worth about five hundred dollars,
while an ostrich rates at three hundred dollars. The
price-list shows that, although expenses may be heavy,
receipts are proportionately large, and that it does not
require many large beasts to make a good business for
one trader. A New York house in three years sold
twenty lions, twelve elephants, six giraffes, four Bengal
tigers, eight leopards, eight hyenas, twelve ostriches
and two hippopotami, being a total business of about
$112,000, or over $37,000 per annum, in the line of
larger beasts alone, exclusive of the smaller show-beasts,
such as monkeys, and exclusive also of birds,
which latter items more than double the amount given.
Gnus, or horned-horses, have come into great demand
of late years, both from their oddity and rarity, and
are valued at seventeen or eighteen hundred dollars
apiece. An elephant is always in demand, and sells,
whether it be male or female, large or small, "trick"
or otherwise. Ostriches, though heavy eaters, are not
very expensive, as they have cast-iron stomachs and
digest stone, glass, iron, or almost anything else that
one chooses to give them, though they are judges
of good meat when they get it. They are not the only
creatures that eat glass. Heller or Houdin&mdash;I forget
which of these magicians&mdash;found a taste among Oriental
jugglers for pounded glass, which they ate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">602</a></span>
large quantities. A trial by the Caucasian trickster
developed the fact that glass was not only not injurious
when taken in reasonable doses, but that it served as
an appetizer, stimulating the stomach to hunger after
food. There are two species of ostrich known to the
trade, the black and the gray; both are very strong,
fleet, and practically untamable. Lions, tigers and
leopards form constituent attractions of almost all
menageries, and are too familiar to need description.
It may be here remembered, however, that people who
deal with these creatures find that there is comparatively
little danger to themselves to be dreaded from
either lions or lionesses. These animals never attack
any human being, save when excessively hungry; and
when enraged, from any cause, always show such visible
signs as put their keepers on their guard; whereas,
the opposite of these statements is true in regard to
tigers and leopards&mdash;the latter especially, which are
regarded by those in the trade as the most dangerous,
cruel and treacherous of all the beasts with which they
are brought in contact. American lions or jaguars,
and American or Brazilian tigers are very fierce, untamable
and strong, although inferior in size to the
lion or tiger proper. Of monkeys and baboons little
more than has already been said need be repeated here.
There are about one hundred and fifty different species
of these creatures, the most intelligent of which is the
ringtailed monkey, and the most stupid, that variety
known as the lion monkey, from its being gifted,
instead of brains, with a long mane. The variety of
deer and antelope are numerous, and always find ready
purchasers; the genuine antelope will bring two or
three hundred dollars in the market.</p>

<p>A show of wild animals is one thing, and a very
good thing sometimes; but the same number of wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">603</a></span>
beasts when not in show&mdash;but merely in winter quarters
or out and awaiting sale, presents a different, and,
sometimes, a curious spectacle. Thus in a certain
back yard in the city of New York, as singular a sight
is presented to the lover of animal life as is afforded
probably in the range of the whole world. You enter
by a low doorway, and at first glance you see only a
number of boxes, with iron bars in front&mdash;amateur
cages in fact&mdash;and arranged alongside of each other,
just as cases may be, without the slightest order or
general arrangement. If you look a second time at
these boxes you will be made aware of the fact that
they are inhabited by certain moving animals; for
pairs of bright eyes will gleam out upon you through
the iron bars and occasional switching of some beastly
tails against the sides of the cages will become audible,
as will every now and then a deep smothered roar.
Inspecting the box-cages or cage-boxes, more closely
you will see, further, that one of them contains a three-year
old lion, just getting his young moustache, or,
what answers the same purpose to a lion&mdash;his mane.
Next box to this you will find a lioness, about the same
age as her mate, a fine specimen of African female,
who seems very much attached to a dog that shares
her cage with her in perfect harmony, at least so far
as the lioness is concerned, for she does all she can to
live at peace with the dog, yielding to his wishes in all
particulars, giving up her meat whenever he takes a
fancy to it, and getting out of his way whenever he
wishes to walk about, although doggy does not seem
to be a very amiable partner, and every now and then
gives the lioness a bit of his mind by biting her in the
ear. A little beyond this strange couple lie two more
boxes&mdash;the upper one containing a pair of young
hunting leopards, as playful as young kittens, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">604</a></span>
spend their time in calling to the cats of the neighborhood,
the lower one being the scene of the imprisonment
of a full-grown, very handsome, very cross
leopardess, who is always snarling and seeking whom
or what she may devour. This latter beast has a
special antipathy to a young lad who has charge of her,
and tries half a dozen times a day to make mince-meat
of him. On the opposite side are a number of boxes,
containing monkeys of various species and baboons.
One of these monkeys is a jovial female, christened
Victoria, and is one of the most expert pickpockets in
New York, which is saying a great deal. Vic can
relieve a visitor of his watch and chain or pocket-book
in a manner most refreshing to a monkey and moralist
to witness, and although as ugly as sin is as quick as
lightning. Next door to this kleptomaniac ape is a
happy family of monkeys&mdash;father, mother and baby&mdash;who
live together lively as clams at the turn of tide.
On the ground, at a little distance, lies another box,
which contains a monster baboon. This fellow is
called Jonas, and is, without exception, the ugliest
individual in existence to which the Almighty has ever
given a shape&mdash;such as it is. These big apes are frequently
palmed off on the public for gorillas; they are
strong as giants, gentle as lambs, and can be taught
tricks like dogs. As in the case of canines, severity
and kindness are resorted to in training them. Prof.
Harry Parker, in speaking to me about educating his
dogs, said he rarely used the whip upon them, but
endeavored, by properly feeding and speaking kind
words to them, to make them obedient to his command,
still the whip must be used. Dogs that hop
around on two feet have their little limbs lashed from
under them until they almost feel the sting of the rawhide
in the tone of the trainer's voice. Clown dogs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">605</a></span>
which have recently been prominent features of circuses
and variety shows, are taught to go through every
article that is put down upon the floor by their
masters; that is why they squirm through a hoop, run
under and overturn chairs, pass under bundles and
upset the leaping basket that is used in dog circuses.
Prof. Parker and Prof. Willis Cobb, I may here
remark, are the best dog-trainers in the country, and
both have large and fine collections of educated canines.</p>

<p>In the rear portion of the yard which we have been
visiting is an inclosure, in which three or four horned
horses or ponies, called gnus, are digesting their
rations; next to these is a case in which is confined a
fretful porcupine, who shows his bristles on the least
provocation, and sometimes when there is no insult
meant at all. The catalogue of cages or boxes is completed
by that in which is held in duress a Brazilian
tiger of the fiercest possible description, who does
nothing but glare upon you and want to eat you. The
meat-eaters in the collection are fed only once a day&mdash;at
noon&mdash;and cost about a dollar per day to feed; the
fruit-eaters, like the elephant, eat all the time, as fancy
prompts; while the vegetarians, like the monkeys, take
their three square meals a day. As a rule, all animals
enjoy a better average of health than man, because
they have no acquired tastes or dissipated habits. The
elephant lives for centuries; the parrot is a centenarian,
while the lion lives but twenty years or so. On
the whole, the average life of man is greater than that
of the majority of the so-called beasts, though their
average of health exceeds his.</p>

<p>Wax-works, of one kind or other, enter into the display
made in the menagerie tent; but the figures all
seem broken or enfeebled by long usage, and instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">606</a></span>
being attractive, many of them are repulsive. How
different from Madame Tussaud's exhibition&mdash;the
prototype of all the efforts that have been made in the
wax-work line! A correspondent who visited this display
many years ago, when the display had a world-wide
fame, <span class="locked">wrote:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Madame Tussaud's famous exhibition of wax statuary
and works in wax afforded me a very entertaining
evening's occupation. Here are full-length portraits
in wax of all the notables of the world; Queen Victoria,
Prince Albert, the royal children, George III.,
Queen Charlotte, George IV., William IV., George
II., Louis XIV., Emperor Louis Napoleon and his
empress in their bridal costume, Henry VIII., Cardinal
Wolsey, all the present sovereigns of Europe, Kossuth,
Gen. Tom Thumb, etc., numbering nearly two
hundred figures in all, so artistically arranged and so
well executed that the effect upon the visitor on entering
is the same as on coming into a grand drawing-room
filled with noble ladies and gentlemen. So perfect is
everything that you look to hear the figures speak, and
can hardly convince yourself that they do not move.</p>

<p>"The second room of Madame Tussaud's exhibition
is called the Robe Room, which contains the figure of
George IV. wearing the order of the Garter. This
robe was worn by his majesty in the procession to
Westminster Abbey, at his coronation. To the right
of this is the robe the same monarch wore at the opening
of Parliament, and on the left the robe worn by
the King in returning to Westminster Abbey after the
coronation. The cost of these three robes was about
$90,000. The third room of the exhibition is called
the Golden Chamber, and contains relics of the Emperor
Napoleon, among which is the camp bedstead
used by Napoleon during his seven years at St. Helena,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">607</a></span>
with the mattress and pillow on which he died; the
coronation robe of Napoleon and the robe of the Empress
Josephine; the celebrated flag of Elba; the
sword worn by the Emperor during his campaign in
Egypt, and many other relics of him. In another room
is the carriage in which Napoleon made the campaign
of Russia, and which was captured on the evening of
the battle of Waterloo; also the carriage he used at
St. Helena, in which, of course, I sat down, according
to custom.</p>

<p>"In another room are many relics of the French
Revolution, among which are the instruments by which
the unfortunate Louis XIV. was beheaded, as also
Robespierre and others. These are but a few of the
many curious and interesting objects to be seen at this
exceedingly entertaining exhibition; and I passed several
hours here, quite lost in the examination of the
collection and the recollections which the various articles
awakened."</p>

<p>The menagerie, no matter how small or how extensive
it may be, always has much within its cages and
lying around under its canvas to interest young and
old alike. It is like a volume of natural history that
may be forever studied without exhausting the interest
that attaches to it, and the knowledge contained in
it. Thrown down after a single perusal, the book is
picked up again and again, and each time its pictures
and pages seem as fresh and entertaining as they were
in the beginning. So, too, the collection of curiosities,
that now-a-days form a very important part of
every tent-show, never loses its attraction for the
public. Gray-haired men who in boyhood looked,
open-mouthed and astonished, into the den of lions,
still find the same pleasure in contemplating these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">608</a></span>
wonderful beasts from a safe distance, and take delight
in making their children acquainted with them. The
tangled forests and matted jungles of new regions are
constantly giving up new specimens of wild animal
life; and with the old reliable attractions still plentiful,
and startling novelties occasionally coming to
the surface, there is every reason to believe that the
menagerie will retain its present hold upon the hearts
of the people, and last as long as there is canvas in
the world to cover one or color enough to fill an ordinary
stand of bills.</p>

<p>Now we have seen about all there is to see. Passing
out and by the side-show blower with his fat woman
and lean man, his glass blower and Irish Circassian
girls, his juggler, and the heartless band of music he
has playing at one end of his dirty tent; we move
down the street, the sound of the side-show music dies
out, the canvas fades behind the house-tops, and we
have left the show world with all its sunshine and
shadow, its laughter and tears.</p>
